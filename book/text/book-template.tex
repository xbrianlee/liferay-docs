\chapter{Preface}

Welcome to the world of Liferay Portal! This book was written for anyone who has
any part in setting up, using, or maintaining a web site built on Liferay
Portal. For the end user, it contains everything you need to know about using
the applications included with Liferay. For the administrator, you'll learn all
you need to know about setting up your site with users, sites, organizations,
and user groups, as well as how to manage your site's security with roles. For
server admins, it guides you step-by-step through the installation,
configuration, and optimization of Liferay Portal, including setting it up in a
clustered, enterprise-ready environment. Use this book as a handbook for
everything you need to do to get your Liferay Portal installation running
smoothly, and then keep it by your side as you configure and maintain your
Liferay-powered web site.

\section{What's New in the Second Edition}

Liferay Portal visually changed a lot in the 6.2 release. This is reflected in 
all the updated screenshots in this book. Of course, everything from the old
book has been updated to reflect the release of Liferay Portal 6.2. We also
have complete coverage of Liferay's new features, such as web content folders, 
the Recycle Bin, Widget Templates, and more. 

There is, of course, coverage of Liferay Marketplace as well as the Plugin
Security Manager. Mobile devices are first-class citizens in Liferay Portal 6.2, 
and we cover how to serve sites to mobile devices, using responsive layouts 
and mobile device rules. We cover the new, split Control Panel UI, which is 
much more convenient, especially for those who want to grant access to content 
functionality, but not administration of the overall portal. We also cover the 
enhancements to staging and the many new settings for sites, including 
membership management, site hierarchies, and more. 

The new release is feature-packed, and so the documentation must be also: we
have over 700 pages of goodness awaiting you in these pages. 

\section{Conventions}

The information contained herein has been organized in a way that makes it easy
to locate information. The book has two parts. The first part, 
\textit{Using Liferay Portal}, describes how to configure and use a freshly 
installed Liferay Portal. The second part, \textit{Deploying Liferay Portal}, 
is for administrators who want to install Liferay Portal and optimize its 
performance. 

Sections are broken up into multiple levels of headings, and these are
designed to make it easy to find information.

Source code and configuration file directives are presented monospaced, as
below.

\begin{verbatim}
If source code goes multi-line, the lines will be \

separated by a backslash character like this.

\end{verbatim}

\textit{Italics} are used to represent links or buttons to be clicked on in a
user interface.

\texttt{Monospaced type} is used to denote Java classes, code, or properties
within the text.

\textbf{Bold} is used to describe field labels and portlets.

Page headers denote the chapters and the section within the chapter.
