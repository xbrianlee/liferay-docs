# Contributing to Liferay Portal

[TOC levels=1-4]

Liferay Portal is developed by its community consisting of users, enthusiasts,
employees, customers, partners, and others. We strongly encourage you to
contribute to Liferay's open source projects by implementing new features,
enhancing existing features, and fixing bugs. We also welcome your participation
in our forums, chat, writing documentation, and translating existing
documentation.

Liferay Portal is known for its innovative top quality features. To maintain
this reputation, all code changes are reviewed by a core set of project
maintainers. We encourage you to join our
[Slack Chat](https://communitychat.liferay.com/)
and introduce yourself to the core maintainer(s) and engage them as you
contribute to the areas they maintain.

Developing features and fixes requires cloning the source tree and building
Liferay Portal. 

## Building Liferay Portal from source

The first step to contributing to Liferay Portal is to clone the
`liferay-portal` repo from GitHub and build the platform from source code.

Please follow the instructions for
[building Liferay Portal from source code](https://portal.liferay.dev/participate/fix-a-bug/building-liferay-source). 

To better understand the code structure, please also read
[How the source is organized](https://portal.liferay.dev/participate/fix-a-bug/how-the-source-is-organized).

    development.
-   [Liferay Workspace](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/liferay-workspace):
    a generated Gradle/Maven environment built to hold and manage Liferay Portal
    projects.
-   [Liferay Dev Studio](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/liferay-dev-studio):
    an Eclipse-based IDE supporting development for Liferay Portal.
-   [Liferay IntelliJ Plugin](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/intellij):
    a plugin providing support for Liferay Portal development with IntelliJ 
    IDEA.
-   [Liferay Theme Generator](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/theme-generator):
    a generator that creates themes, layouts templates, and themelets for 
    Liferay Portal development.
-   [Liferay JS Generator](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/js-generator):
    a generator that creates JavaScript portlets with JavaScript tooling.

The
