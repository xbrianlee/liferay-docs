Liferay's OSGi framework lets you build applications composed of multiple OSGi
bundles (modules). For the framework to assemble the modules into a working
system, the modules must resolve their Java package dependencies. In a perfect
world, every Java library would be an OSGi module, but many libraries aren't. So
how do you resolve the packages your project needs from non-OSGi third party
libraries?

Here is the main workflow for resolving third party Java library packages:

**Option 1 - Find an OSGi module of the library**: Projects, such as
[Eclipse Orbit](https://www.eclipse.org/orbit/)
and
[ServiceMix Bundles](https://servicemix.apache.org/developers/source/bundles-source.html), 
convert hundreds of traditional Java libraries to OSGi modules. Their artifacts
are available at these locations:

-   [Eclipse Orbit downloads \(select a build\)](https://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/)
-   [ServiceMix Bundles](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.servicemix.bundles)

Deploying the module to Liferay's OSGi framework lets you share it on the
system. If you find a module for the library you need,
[deploy](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/deploying-a-project) it. Then
[add a compile-only
dependency](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/specifying-dependencies)
for it in your project. When you deploy your project, the OSGi framework wires
the dependency module to your project's module or web application bundle (WAB).
If you don't find an OSGi module based on the Java library, follow Option 2. 

| **Tip:** Refrain from embedding library JARs that provide the same 
| [packages that @product@ or existing modules provide already](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/third-party-packages-portal-exports). 
 
| **Note:** If you're developing a WAR that requires a different version of a
| third-party package that
| [@product@ or another module exports](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/third-party-packages-portal-exports),
| specify that package in your
| [`Import-Package:` list](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/importing-packages).
| If the package provider is an OSGi module, publish its exported packages by 
| deploying that module. Otherwise, rename the third-party library (not an OSGi 
| module) differently from the
| [JAR that the WAB generator excludes](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/understanding-excluded-jars)
| and embed the JAR in your project. 

**Option 2 - Resolve the Java packages privately in your project**: Copy
*required packages* only from libraries into your project, if you can or embed
*libraries* wholesale, if you must. The rest of this article shows you how to
do these things. 

| **Note:** Features for manipulating library packages are only available to 
| module projects that use bnd  and the `com.liferay.plugin` plugin, such as
| [Liferay Workspace](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/liferay-workspace)
| modules. WAR projects must embed libraries wholesale into their classpath. 

| **Note**: Liferay's Gradle plugin `com.liferay.plugin` automates several third
| party library configuration steps. The plugin is automatically applied to
| [Liferay Workspace](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/liferay-workspace)
| Gradle module projects created using
| [Liferay @ide@](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/liferay-dev-studio)
| or
| [Liferay Blade CLI](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/blade-cli).
| 
| To leverage the `com.liferay.plugin` plugin outside of Liferay Workspace, add
| code like the listing below to your Gradle project and update the version of 
| the `com.liferay.gradle.plugins` artifact to the latest version found in the 
| repository:
| 
|     buildscript {
|         dependencies {
|             classpath group: "com.liferay", name: "com.liferay.gradle.plugins", version: "4.0.4"
|         }
| 
|         repositories {
|             maven {
|                 url "https://repository.liferay.com/nexus/content/repositories/liferay-public-releases/"
|             }
|         }
|     }
| 
|     apply plugin: "com.liferay.plugin"
| 
| If you use Gradle without the `com.liferay.plugin` plugin, you must
| [embed the third party libraries wholesale](#embedding-libraries-using-gradle).

The recommended package resolution workflow is next. 

## Library Package Resolution Workflow

When you depend on a library JAR, much of the time you only need parts of it.
Explicitly specifying only the Java packages you need makes your module more
modular. This also keeps other modules that depend on your module from
incorporating unneeded packages. 

Here's a configuration workflow for module projects that minimizes dependencies
and Java package imports:

1.  Add the library as a compile-only dependency (e.g., `compileOnly` in
    Gradle, `<scope>provided</scope>` in Maven).

2.  Copy only the library packages you need by specifying them in a conditional
    package instruction (`Conditional-Package`) in your `bnd.bnd` file. Here are
    some examples:

    `Conditional-Package: foo.common*` adds packages your module uses such as
    `foo.common`, `foo.common-messages`, `foo.common-web` to your module's
    class path.

    `Conditional-Package: foo.bar.*` adds packages your module uses such as
    `foo.bar` and all its sub-packages (e.g., `foo.bar.baz`, `foo.bar.biz`,
    etc.) to your module's class path.

    [Deploy your
    project](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/deploying-a-project). If a
    class your module needs or class its dependencies need isn't found, go back
    to main workflow **Step 1 - Find an OSGi module version of the library** to
    resolve it. 

    **Important**: Resolving packages by using compile-only dependencies and
    conditional package instructions assures you use only the packages you need
    and avoids unnecessary transitive dependencies. It's recommended to use the
    steps up to this point, as much as possible, to resolve required packages.  

3.  If a library package you depend on requires non-class files (e.g., DLLs,
    descriptors) from the library, then you might need to
    [embed the library wholesale in your module](#embedding-libraries-in-a-project).
    This adds the entire library to your module's classpath.

Next you'll learn how to embed libraries in your module project. 

## Embedding Libraries in a Project

You can use Gradle or Maven to embed libraries in your project. Below are
examples for adding
[Apache Shiro](https://shiro.apache.org)
using both build utilities. 

### Embedding Libraries Using Gradle

Open your module's `build.gradle` file and add the library as a dependency in
the `compileInclude` configuration:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compileInclude group: 'org.apache.shiro', name: 'shiro-core', version: '1.1.0'
}
```

The `com.liferay.plugin` plugin's `compileInclude` configuration is transitive.
The `compileInclude` configuration embeds the artifact and all its dependencies
in a `lib` folder in the module's JAR. Also, it adds the artifact JARs to the
module's `Bundle-ClassPath` manifest header. 

**Note**: The `compileInclude` configuration does not download transitive
[optional dependencies](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-optional-and-excludes-dependencies.html).
If your module requires such artifacts, add them as you would another third party library.

**Note:** If the library you've added as a dependency in your `build.gradle`
file has transitive dependencies, you can reference them by name in an
`-includeresource:` instruction without having to add them explicitly to the
dependency list. See how it's used in the Maven section next. 

### Embedding a Library Using Maven

Follow these steps:

1.  Open your project's `pom.xml` file and add the library as a dependency in 
    the `provided` scope:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.shiro</groupId>
      <artifactId>shiro-core</artifactId>
      <version>1.1.0</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
    ```

2.  Open your module's `bnd.bnd` file and add the library to an
    `-includeresource` instruction: 

        -includeresource: META-INF/lib/shiro-core.jar=shiro-core-[0-9]*.jar;lib:=true

    This instruction adds the `shiro-core-[version].jar` file as an included
    resource in the module's `META-INF/lib` folder. The
    `META-INF/lib/shiro-core.jar` is your module's embedded library. The
    expression `[0-9]*` helps the build tool match the library version 
    to make available on the module's class path. The `lib:=true` directive adds
    the embedded JAR to the module's class path via the `Bundle-Classpath`
    manifest header.

Lastly, if after embedding a library you get unresolved imports when trying to
deploy to Liferay, you might need to blacklist some imports: 

```    
Import-Package:\
    !foo.bar.baz,\
    *
```

The `*` character represents all packages that the module refers to explicitly. Bnd detects the referenced packages.

Congratulations! Resolving all of your module's package dependencies, especially
those from traditional Java libraries, is a quite an accomplishment.
