Plugins often must use Java classes from packages outside of themselves. Another
OSGi bundle (a module or an OSGi Web Application Bundle) in the OSGi framework
must
[export](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/exporting-packages)
a package for your plugin to import it.

When an OSGi bundle (bundle) is set up to import packages, the OSGi framework
finds other registered bundles that export the needed packages and wires them to
the importing bundle. At run time, the importing bundle gets the class from the
wired bundle that exports the class's package.

For this to happen, a bundle's `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file must specify the
[`Import-Package`](https://bnd.bndtools.org/heads/import_package.html) OSGi manifest header with a comma-separated list of the Java
packages it needs. For example, if a bundle needs classes from the
`javax.portlet` and `com.liferay.portal.kernel.util` packages, it must specify
them like so:

```
Import-Package: javax.portlet,com.liferay.portal.kernel.util,*
```

The `*` character represents all packages that the module refers to explicitly. Bnd detects the referenced packages.

Import packages must sometimes be specified manually, but not always.
Conveniently, @product@
[project templates](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/project-templates)
and
[tools](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/tooling)
automatically detect the packages a bundle uses and add them to the package
imports in the bundle's manifest. Here are the different package import
scenarios:

- [Automatic Package Import Generation](#automatic-package-import-generation)

- [Manually Adding Package Imports](#manually-adding-package-imports)

Let's explore how package imports are specified in these scenarios.

## Automatic Package Import Generation

[Gradle and Maven module projects](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/project-templates)
created using
[Blade CLI](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/blade-cli),
[Liferay's Maven archetypes](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/maven),
or
[Liferay @ide@](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/liferay-dev-studio)
use
[bnd](http://bnd.bndtools.org/).
On building such a project's module JAR, bnd detects the packages the module
uses and generates a `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file whose `Import-Package` header
specifies the packages.

| **Note:** Liferay's Maven module archetypes use the `bnd-maven-plugin`.
| Liferay's Gradle module project templates use
| [a third-party Gradle plugin](https://github.com/TomDmitriev/gradle-bundle-plugin)
| to invoke bnd.

For example, suppose you're developing a Liferay module using Maven or Gradle.
In most cases, you specify your module's dependencies in your `pom.xml` or
`build.gradle` file. At build time, the Maven or Gradle module plugin reads your
`pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file and bnd adds the required `Import-Package`
headers to your module JAR's `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`.

Here's an example dependencies section from a module's `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compileOnly group: "com.liferay.portal", name: "com.liferay.portal.kernel", version: "2.0.0"
    compileOnly group: "javax.portlet", name: "portlet-api", version: "2.0"
    compileOnly group: "org.osgi", name: "org.osgi.service.component.annotations", version: "1.3.0"
}
```

And here's the `Import-Package` header that's generated in the module JAR's
`META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file:

    Import-Package: com.liferay.portal.kernel.portlet.bridges.mvc;version=
    "[1.0,2)",com.liferay.portal.kernel.util;version="[7.0,8)",javax.nami
    ng,javax.portlet;version="[2.0,3)",javax.servlet,javax.servlet.http,j
    avax.sql

Note that your build file need only specify artifact dependencies. bnd examines
your module's class path to determine which packages from those artifacts
contain classes your application uses and imports the packages. The examination
includes all classes found in the class path--even those from embedded
[third party library JARs](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/adding-third-party-libraries-to-a-module).

Regarding classes used by a plugin WAR,
[Liferay's WAB Generator](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/deploying-wars-wab-generator)
detects their use in the WAR's JSPs, descriptor files, and classes (in
`WEB-INF/classes` and embedded JARs). The WAB Generator searches the `web.xml`,
`liferay-web.xml`, `portlet.xml`, `liferay-portlet.xml`, and `liferay-hook.xml`
descriptor files. It adds package imports for classes that are neither found in
the plugin's `WEB-INF/classes` folder nor in its embedded JARs.

| **Note:** Packages for Java APIs, such as Java Portlet, aren't semantically
| versioned but have Portable Java Contracts. Each API's contract specifies the
| JSR it satisfies. Bundles that use these APIs must specify requirements on the
| API contracts. The contract requirement specifies your bundle's relationship
| with the imported API packages. If the system you're running does *not*
| provide the exact contract, your bundle does not resolve. Resolving the
| missing package is better than handling an incompatibility failure during
| execution.
|
| -   **Blade CLI and Liferay @ide@ module projects** specify Portable Java
|     Contracts automatically! For example, if your Blade CLI or Liferay @ide@
|     module uses the Java Portlet API and you compile against the Java Portlet
|     2.0 artifact, a contract requirement for the package is added to your
|     module's manifest.
|
| -   **Module projects that use bnd but are not created using Blade CLI or
|     Liferay @ide@** must specify contracts in their `bnd.bnd` file. For
|     example, here are contract instructions for Java Portlet and Java Servlet
|     APIs:
|
|         -contract: JavaPortlet,JavaServlet
|
|     At build time, bnd adds the contract instructions to your module's
|     manifest. It adds a requirement for the first version of the API found in
|     your classpath and *removes* version range information from
|     `Import-Package` entries for corresponding API packages---the package
|     version information isn't needed.
|
| -   **Projects that don't use bnd** must specify contracts in their OSGi
|     bundle manifest. For example, here's the specified contract for
|     `JavaPortlet` 2.0, which goes in your `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file:
|
|         Import-Package: javax.portlet
|         Require-Capability: osgi.contract;filter:=(&(osgi.contract=JavaPortlet)(version=2.0))
|
| For Portable Java Contract details, see
| [Portable Java Contract Definitions](https://www.osgi.org/portable-java-contract-definitions/).

## Manually Adding Package Imports

The WAB Generator and bnd don't add package imports for classes referenced in
these places:

-   Unrecognized descriptor file
-   Custom or unrecognized descriptor element or attribute
-   Reflection code
-   Class loader code

In such cases, you must manually determine these packages and specify an `Import-Package` OSGi header that includes these packages and the packages that Bnd detects automatically. The `Import-Package` header belongs in the location appropriate to your project type:

| Project type | `Import-Package` header location |
| :----------- | :------------------------------- |
| Module (uses bnd)     | `[project]/bnd.bnd` |
| Module (doesn't use bnd) | `[module JAR]/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` |
| Traditional Liferay plugin WAR | `WEB-INF/liferay-plugin-package.properties` |

Here's an example of adding a package called `com.liferay.docs.foo` to the list of referenced packages that Bnd detects automatically:

```
Import-Package:\
    com.liferay.docs.foo,\
    *
```

| **Note:** The
| [WAB Generator](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/deploying-wars-wab-generator)
| refrains from adding WAR project embedded
| third-party JARs to a WAB if
| [@product@ already exports the JAR's packages](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/understanding-excluded-jars).
|
| If your WAR requires a different version of a third-party package that
| @product@ exports, specify that package in your `Import-Package:` list. Then
| if the package provider is an OSGi module, publish its exported packages by
| deploying the module. If the package provider is not an OSGi module, follow
| the instructions for
| [adding third-party libraries](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/adding-third-party-libraries-to-a-module).

Please see the [`Import-Package`](https://bnd.bndtools.org/heads/import_package.html) header documentation for more information.

Congratulations! Now you can import all kinds of packages for your modules and
plugins to use.
