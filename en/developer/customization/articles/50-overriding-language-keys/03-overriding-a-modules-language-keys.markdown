# Overriding a Module's Language Keys

[TOC levels=1-4]

What do you do if the language keys you want to modify are in one of Liferay's 
applications or another module whose source code you don't control? Since module 
language keys are in the respective module, the process for overriding a 
module's language keys is different from 
[the process of overriding Liferay's language keys](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/overriding-global-language-keys). 

Here is the process:

1.  [Find the module and its metadata and language keys](#find-the-module-and-its-metadata-and-language-keys)
2.  [Write your custom language key values](#write-custom-language-key-values) 
3.  [Prioritize your module's resource bundle](#prioritize-your-modules-resource-bundle)

## Find the module and its metadata and language keys

In [Gogo shell](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/using-the-felix-gogo-shell), 
list the bundles and grep for keyword(s) that match the portlet's display name. 
Language keys are in the portlet's web module (bundle). When you find the 
bundle, note its ID number.

To find the Blogs portlet, for example, your Gogo commands and output might look 
like this:

    g! lb | grep Blogs
      152|Active     |    1|Liferay Blogs Service (1.0.2)
      184|Active     |    1|Liferay Blogs Editor Config (2.0.1)
      202|Active     |    1|Liferay Blogs Layout Prototype (2.0.2)
      288|Active     |    1|Liferay Blogs Recent Bloggers Web (1.0.2)
      297|Active     |    1|Liferay Blogs Item Selector Web (1.0.2)
      374|Active     |    1|Liferay Blogs Item Selector API (2.0.1)
      448|Active     |    1|Liferay Blogs API (3.0.1)
      465|Active     |    1|Liferay Blogs Web (1.0.6)
    true

List the bundle's headers by passing its ID to the `headers` command. 

    g! headers 465

    Liferay Blogs Web (465)
    -----------------------
    Manifest-Version = 1.0
    Bnd-LastModified = 1459866186018
    Bundle-ManifestVersion = 2
    Bundle-Name = Liferay Blogs Web
    Bundle-SymbolicName = com.liferay.blogs.web
    Bundle-Version: 1.0.6
    ... 
    Web-ContextPath = /blogs-web
    g! 

Note the `Bundle-SymbolicName`, `Bundle-Version`, and `Web-ContextPath`. The 
`Web-ContextPath` value, following the `/`, is the servlet context name. 

**Important**: Record the servlet context name, bundle symbolic name and 
version, as you'll use them to create the resource bundle loader later in the 
process. 

For example, here are those values for Liferay Blogs Web module:

- Bundle symbolic name: `com.liferay.blogs.web`
- Bundle version: `4.0.16`
- Servlet context name: `blogs-web`

Next find the module's JAR file so you can examine its language keys. Liferay 
follows this module JAR file naming convention:

    [bundle symbolic name]-[version].jar

For example, the Blogs Web version 4.0.16 module is in
`com.liferay.blogs.web-4.0.16.jar`.

Here's where to find the module JAR:

-   Liferay's [Nexus repository](https://repository.liferay.com/nexus/content/repositories/liferay-public-releases/com/liferay/)
-  `[Liferay Home]/osgi/modules`
-   Embedded in an application's or application suite's LPKG file in `[Liferay
    Home]/osgi/marketplace`.

The language property files are in the module's `src/main/resources/content` 
folder. Identify the language keys you want to override in the 
`Language[_xx].properties` files. 

Checkpoint: Make sure you have the required information for overriding the 
module's language keys:

-   Language keys
-   Bundle symbolic name
-   Servlet context name

Next you'll write new values for the language keys. 

## Write custom language key values

Create a new module to hold a resource bundle loader and your custom language 
keys. 

In your module's `src/main/resources/content` folder, create 
[language properties files](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/localizing-your-application) 
for each locale whose keys you want to override. In each language properties 
file, specify your language key overrides. 

Next you'll prioritize your module's language keys as a resource bundle for the 
target module. 

## Prioritize Your Module's Resource Bundle

Now that your language keys are in place, use OSGi manifest headers to specify 
the language keys are for the target module. To compliment the target module's 
resource bundle, you'll aggregate your resource bundle with the target module's 
resource bundle. You'll list your module first to prioritize its resource bundle 
over the target module resource bundle.  Here's an example of module 
`com.liferay.docs.l10n.myapp.lang` prioritizing its resource bundle over target 
module `com.liferay.blogs.web`'s resource bundle:

```properties
Provide-Capability:\
liferay.resource.bundle;resource.bundle.base.name="content.Language",\
liferay.resource.bundle;resource.bundle.aggregate:String="(bundle.symbolic.name=com.liferay.docs.l10n.myapp.lang),(bundle.symbolic.name=com.liferay.blogs.web)";bundle.symbolic.name=com.liferay.blogs.web;resource.bundle.base.name="content.Language";service.ranking:Long="2";\
servlet.context.name=blogs-web
```

The example `Provide-Capability` header has two parts: 

1.  `liferay.resource.bundle;resource.bundle.base.name="content.Language"` 
    declares that the module provides a resource bundle with the base name 
    `content.language`. 

2.  The `liferay.resource.bundle;resource.bundle.aggregate:String=...` directive 
    specifies the list of bundles with resource bundles to aggregate, the 
    target bundle, the target bundle's resource bundle name, and this service's 
    ranking:

    -   `"(bundle.symbolic.name=com.liferay.docs.l10n.myapp.lang),(bundle.symbolic.name=com.liferay.blogs.web)"`:
        The service aggregates resource bundles from bundles 
        `com.liferay.docs.l10n.myapp.lang` and `com.liferay.blogs.web`. 
        Aggregate as many bundles as desired. Listed bundles are prioritized in 
        descending order. 
    -   `bundle.symbolic.name=com.liferay.blogs.web;resource.bundle.base.name="content.Language"`:
        Override the `com.liferay.blogs.web` bundle's resource bundle named 
        `content.Language`. 
    -   `service.ranking:Long="2"`: The resource bundle's service ranking is 
        `2`. The OSGi framework applies this service if it outranks all other 
        resource bundle services that target `com.liferay.blogs.web`'s 
        `content.Language` resource bundle. 
    -   `servlet.context.name=blogs-web`: The target resource bundle is in 
        servlet context `blogs-web`. 

[Deploy your module](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/deploying-a-project) 
to see the language keys you've overridden. 

| **Tip:** If your override isn't showing, use 
| [Gogo Shell](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/using-the-felix-gogo-shell) 
| to check for competing resource bundle services. It may be that another service 
| outranks yours. To check for competing resource bundle services whose aggregates 
| include `com.liferay.blogs.web`'s resource bundle, for example, execute this 
| Gogo Shell command:
| 
|     services "(bundle.symbolic.name=com.liferay.login.web)"
| 
| Search the results for resource bundle aggregate services whose ranking is 
| higher.

Now you can modify the language keys of modules in Liferay's OSGi runtime. 
Remember, language keys you want to override might actually be in Liferay's 
core. You can [override Liferay's language keys](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/overriding-language-keys) 
too.
