# Customizing Workflow

[TOC levels=1-4]

Liferay's workflow engine calls users to participate in a review process
designed for them. Out of the box, workflow makes it possible to define simple
to complex business processes/workflows, deploy them, and manage them through
a portal interface.

Workflow is flexible, in that you can design workflow processes in XML to suit
your business needs.

In @product@ version 7.2, a new set of workflow features was introduced around
the concept of
[Workflow Metrics](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/creating-sla-calendars).

The embedded calendar that ships out of the box can be replaced by your own
custom calendar service. More customization points will likely be added in the
future.
