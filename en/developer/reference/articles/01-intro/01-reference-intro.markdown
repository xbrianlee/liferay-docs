# Developer Reference

[TOC levels=1-4]

This developer reference contains lists of options for various APIs. The actual
API reference is stored on [docs.liferay.com](https://docs.liferay.com). Here,
you'll find higher level descriptions of those APIs, lists of tag libraries,
descriptions of Gradle and Maven plugins, and much more. 

One highlight here is a complete description of Liferay's development tooling.
This includes not only our Blade CLI (a tool that bridges the gap between Gradle
and Maven, bringing archetype-like functionality to Liferay Gradle projects),
but also our plugins for IntelliJ and Eclipse, not to mention our Maven or
Gradle-based Liferay Workspace. It also includes a complete description of our
JS Generator, which helps front-end developers create pure JavaScript widgets.
