# Deploying a Project

[TOC levels=1-4]

Deploying a project to @product@ can be completed using your tool of choice. The
following tools are preconfigured (or can be easily configured) for Liferay
project generation:

- [Blade CLI](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/blade-cli)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
- [Liferay Dev Studio](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/liferay-dev-studio)
- [Liferay IntelliJ Plugin](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/intellij)
- [Maven](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/maven)

The deployment process is the same across all tools; the deployment
command/action builds and deploys your project based on the build tool's
deployment configuration. For example, leveraging Blade CLI in a default Gradle
Liferay Workspace uses the underlying Gradle deployment configuration. The build
tool's deployment configuration is found by reading the Liferay Home folder. The
Liferay Home folder is preconfigured in most cases; if it's not, ways to
configure it are included below. All tools support JAR and WAR-style project
deployment.

It's recommended to deploy Liferay projects within a
[Liferay Workspace](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/liferay-workspace).
Most tools, however, support deploying projects in a standalone environment
(except for IntelliJ). Visit the appropriate section to learn how to deploy a
project with the highlighted tool.

## Blade CLI

This is the recommended way to deploy Gradle and Maven projects in a Liferay
Workspace via command line. Blade CLI is leveraged by Dev Studio and IntelliJ
too.

Run this command to deploy your project:

```bash
blade deploy
```

If you prefer not to use your underlying build tool's (Gradle or Maven) module
deployment configuration, and instead, you want to deploy straight to
@product@'s OSGi container, run this command:

```bash
blade deploy -l
```

## Gradle

Deploying with pure Gradle is not recommended unless you prefer to develop
outside of a Liferay Workspace. [Blade CLI](#blade-cli) is a better tool for
deploying Liferay Gradle projects in most cases.

1.  Apply the Liferay Gradle plugin in your project's `build.gradle` file:

    ```groovy
    apply plugin: "com.liferay.plugin"
    ```

2.  Extend the Liferay extension object to set your Liferay Home and `deploy`
    folder:

    ```groovy
    liferay {
        liferayHome = "../../../../liferay-ce-portal-7.1.1-ga2"
        deployDir = file("${liferayHome}/deploy")
    }
    ```

3.  Run this command to deploy your project:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew deploy
    ```

## Liferay Dev Studio

These steps assume you've
[installed a Liferay server in Dev Studio](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/installing-a-liferay-server-in-dev-studio). 

1.  Right-click the server from the Servers window and select *Add and
    Remove...*.

2.  Add the project(s) you'd like to deploy from the Available window to the
    Configured window. Then click *Finish*.

    ![Figure 1: Using the this deployment method is convenient when deploying multiple projects.](../../images/add-and-remove-ide.png)

3.  Verify your project builds, deploys, and starts successfully by viewing the
    results in the Console window.

Dev Studio's deployment mechanism executes the `watch` task behind the scenes.
For more information on what to expect from the `watch` task, see
[this article](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/blade-cli).

## Liferay IntelliJ Plugin

These steps assume you've
[installed a Liferay server in IntelliJ](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/installing-a-server-in-intellij).
A configured Liferay Workspace is required to create and deploy Liferay projects
in IntelliJ.

1.  Right-click your project from within the Liferay Workspace folder structure
    and select *Liferay* &rarr; *Deploy*.

    This automatically loads a build progress window viewable at the bottom of
    your IntelliJ instance.

    ![Figure 2: Verify that your project built successfully.](../../images/intellij-project-build.png)

2.  Verify that your project builds successfully from the build progress window.
    Then navigate back to your server's window and confirm it starts in your
    configured @product@ instance.

## Maven

If you're developing your project in a Liferay Workspace, skip to step 3.

1.  Add the following plugin configuration to your Liferay Maven project's
    parent `pom.xml` file.

    ```xml
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>com.liferay</groupId>
                <artifactId>com.liferay.portal.tools.bundle.support</artifactId>
                <version>3.4.1</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <id>deploy</id>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>deploy</goal>
                        </goals>
                        <phase>pre-integration-test</phase>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
    ```

    This POM configuration applies Liferay's
    [Bundle Support plugin](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/bundle-support-plugin).
    This plugin is applied in Liferay Workspace by default. The Bundle Support
    configuration defines the
    [executions](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-configuring-plugins.html#Using_the_executions_Tag)
    tag, which configures the Bundle Support plugin to run during the
    `pre-integration-test` phase of your Maven project's build lifecycle. The
    [`deploy`](http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#A_Build_Phase_is_Made_Up_of_Plugin_Goals)
    goal is defined for that lifecycle phase. 

2.  Define your Liferay home folder in your POM. You can do this by adding the
    following logic within the `plugin` tags, but outside of the `execution`
    tags:

    ```xml
    <configuration>
        <liferayHome>C:/liferay/liferay-ce-portal-7.1-ga1</liferayHome>
    </configuration>
    ```

3.  Run this command to deploy your project:

    ```bash
    mvn verify
    ```
