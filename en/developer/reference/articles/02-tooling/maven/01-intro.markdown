# Maven

[TOC levels=1-4]

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is a viable option for managing Liferay
projects if you don't want to use Liferay's default Gradle management system.
Liferay provides several
[Maven plugins](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/maven-plugins) for
generating and managing your project. Liferay also provides easy to obtain Maven
artifacts that are required for Liferay Maven module development. Here, you'll
learn how to

- Install Liferay Maven artifacts
- Create/Manage a Maven Repository
- Apply Maven plugins

Because @product@ is tool-agnostic, Maven is fully supported for @product@
development. Read on for details about these topics.

## Installing Liferay Maven Artifacts

To create Liferay projects using Maven, you'll need its dependencies. This isn't
a problem---Liferay provides them as Maven artifacts. You can retrieve them from
a remote repository.

There are two remote repositories that contain Liferay artifacts: Central
Repository and Liferay Repository. The Central Repository is the default
repository used to download artifacts if you don't have a remote repository
configured. Using the Central Repository to install Liferay Maven artifacts only
requires that you 
[specify your module's dependencies](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/configuring-dependencies) 
in its `pom.xml` file. 

When packaging your module, the automatic Maven artifact installation process
only downloads the artifacts necessary for that module from the Central
Repository. 

The Central Repository *usually* offers the latest Liferay Maven artifacts, but
the Liferay Repository *guarantees* access to the latest artifacts released by
Liferay. Other than a slight delay in artifact releases, the two repositories
are identical. When the Liferay repository is configured in your `settings.xml`
file, archetypes are generated based on that repository's contents. The Liferay
Maven repository offers a good alternative for those who want the most
up-to-date Maven artifacts produced by Liferay. 

| **Note:** If you've configured the Liferay Nexus repository to access Liferay
| Maven artifacts and you've already been syncing from the Central Repository,
| you might have to clear out parts of your local repository to force Maven to
| re-download the newer artifacts. Also, don't leave the Liferay repository
| enabled when publishing artifacts to Maven Central. You must comment out the
| Liferay Repository credentials when publishing your artifacts.

Next, you'll learn about managing your Maven artifacts.

## Managing Maven Artifacts in a Repository

You can share Liferay artifacts and modules with teammates or manage your
repositories using a GUI by using
[Sonatype Nexus](http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/). It's a Maven repository
management server for creating and managing release servers, snapshot servers,
and proxy servers. There are several other Maven repository management servers
you can use (for example, [Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/)),
but this section focuses on Nexus.

You'll learn how to

- [Create a repository](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/creating-a-maven-repository)
- [Configure a repository](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/configuring-local-maven-settings-to-access-repositories)
- [Deploy artifacts to a repository](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/deploying-liferay-maven-artifacts-to-a-repository)

Before using repository servers, you must specify them in your Maven environment
settings. Your repository settings let Maven find the repository and retrieve
and install artifacts. You can configure your local Maven settings in the
`[USER_HOME]/.m2/settings.xml` file.

| **Note**: You must only configure a repository server if you're sharing
| artifacts (e.g., Liferay artifacts and/or your modules) with others. If you're
| installing Liferay artifacts from the Central/Liferay Repository
| and aren't interested in sharing artifacts, you don't need a repository server
| specified in your Maven settings. You can find out more about installing
| artifacts from the Central Repository or Liferay's own Nexus repository in the
| [Installing Remote Liferay Maven Artifacts](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/installing-remote-liferay-maven-artifacts)
| article.

To deploy to a remote repository, your Liferay project should be packaged using
Maven. Maven provides a packaging command that creates an artifact (JAR) that
can be easily deployed to your remote repository.

Once you've created a deployable artifact, you can configure your module project
to communicate with your remote repository and use Maven's `deploy` command to
send it on its way. Once your module project resides on the remote repository,
other developers can configure your remote repository in their projects and set
dependencies in their project POMs to reference it.

## Applying Maven Plugins

There are several important Maven plugins that provide important functionality
to Liferay Maven projects. The available Liferay Maven plugins are available in
the [Maven Plugins](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/maven-plugins)
section.

The following tasks are covered in this section:

- [Building an OSGi module JAR](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/building-an-osgi-module-jar-with-maven)
- [Building themes](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/building-a-theme-with-maven)
- [Compiling Sass files](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/compiling-sass-files-in-a-maven-project)
- [Using Service Builder](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/using-service-builder-in-a-maven-project)
