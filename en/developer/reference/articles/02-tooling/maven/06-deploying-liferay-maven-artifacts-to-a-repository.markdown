# Deploying Liferay Maven Artifacts to a Repository

[TOC levels=1-4]

Deploying artifacts to a remote repository is important if you intend to share
your Maven projects with others. First, you must have a remote repository that
can hold deployed Maven artifacts. If you do not currently have a remote
repository,
[create one](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/creating-a-maven-repository).
Also make sure your `[USER_HOME]/.m2/settings.xml` file specifies your remote
repository's ID, user name, and password (configuration instructions
[here](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/configuring-local-maven-settings-to-access-repositories)).

To follow this article, you'll need a Liferay module built with Maven. For
demonstration purposes, this tutorial uses the `portlet.ds` sample module
project. To follow along with this module, download the
[portlet.ds](https://portal.liferay.dev/documents/113763090/114000186/portlet.ds.zip)
Zip. 

Now it's time to deploy a Maven artifact to your Nexus repository.

1.  Create a folder anywhere on your machine to serve as the parent folder
    for your Liferay modules. Unzip the `portlet.ds` module project into that
    folder.

2.  Create a `pom.xml` file inside this folder. Copy the following logic into
    the parent POM:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <project
        xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"
    >

        <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
        <groupId>liferay.sample</groupId>
        <artifactId>liferay.sample.maven</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
        <name>Liferay Maven Module Projects</name>
        <packaging>pom</packaging>

        <distributionManagement>
            <repository>
                <id>liferay-releases</id>
                <url>http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/liferay-releases</url>
            </repository>
        </distributionManagement>

        <modules>
            <module>portlet.ds</module>
        </modules>
    </project>
    ```

    The tags `<modelVersion>` through `<packaging>` are POM tags that are
    used frequently in parent POMs. Visit Maven's
    [POM Reference](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html) documentation for more
    information.

    The `<distributionManagement>` tag specifies the deployment repository for
    all module projects residing in the parent folder. This repository should
    also be specified in your `[USER_HOME]/.m2/settings.xml`. Both the parent
    POM and `settings.xml` file's repository declarations are required to deploy
    your modules to that remote repository.

    Finally, you must list the modules residing in the parent folder that you
    want deployed using the `<modules>` tag. The `portlet.ds` module is
    specified within that tag.

3.  Open the `portlet.ds` module's `pom.xml` file. If you did not download the
    `portlet.ds` module project Zip, you can reference its POM below. 

    ```xml
    <project
        xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"
    >

        <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
        <artifactId>portlet.ds</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
        <packaging>jar</packaging>

        <parent>
            <groupId>liferay.sample</groupId>
            <artifactId>liferay.sample.maven</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0</version>
            <relativePath>../pom.xml</relativePath>
        </parent>

        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>javax.portlet</groupId>
                <artifactId>portlet-api</artifactId>
                <version>2.0</version>
                <scope>provided</scope>
            </dependency>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.osgi</groupId>
                <artifactId>org.osgi.service.component.annotations</artifactId>
                <version>1.3.0</version>
                <scope>provided</scope>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>
    </project>
    ```

    The `portlet.ds` module's POM specifies its own attributes first, followed
    by the parent POM's attributes. Declaring the `<parent>` tag like above
    links the `portlet.ds` module to its parent POM, which is necessary to
    deploy to the remote repository. Then the module's dependencies are listed.
    These dependencies are downloaded from the Central Repository and
    installed to your local `.m2` repository when you package the `portlet.ds`
    module.

4.  Now that you've configured your parent POM and module POM, package your
    Maven project. Navigate to your module project (e.g., `project.ds`) using
    the command line and run the Maven package command:

    ```bash
    mvn package
    ```

    This downloads and installs all your module's dependencies and packages the
    project into a JAR file. Navigate to your module project's generated build
    folder (e.g., `/target`). You'll notice there is a newly generated JAR file.
    This is the artifact you'll deploy to your Nexus repository.

5.  Run Maven's deploy command to deploy your module project's artifact to your
    configured remote repository.

    ```bash
    mvn deploy
    ```

    Your console shows output from the artifact being deployed into your
    repository server.

To verify that your artifact is deployed, navigate to the *Repositories* page of
your Nexus server and select your repository. A window appears below showing
the Liferay artifact now deployed to your repository.

Awesome! You can now share your Liferay module projects with anyone by deploying
them as artifacts to your remote repository!
