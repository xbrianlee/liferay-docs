Liferay Workspace provides the `wars` folder for any WAR-style project. Themes
created with
[Blade CLI](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/blade-cli) or Maven
using the
[`theme`](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/theme-template) project
template or archetype are automatically generated here when creating the project
within Workspace.

Follow the steps below to build a Gradle/Maven theme in workspace's `wars`
folder:

1.  Follow the
    [Creating a Project](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/creating-a-project)
    article to generate a project based on a project template or archetype. Make
    sure to select the `theme` template.

    Themes built using Liferay's `theme` project template are always WARs and
    should always reside in Workspace's `wars` folder. They should never be
    moved to the `themes` folder; that folder is reserved for
    [themes generated by the Theme Generator](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/building-node-js-themes-in-liferay-workspace).

2.  Navigate into your new theme and run

    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```

    Liferay Workspace builds the theme using Gradle. Under the hood, Liferay's 
    [Theme Builder Gradle Plugin](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/theme-builder-gradle-plugin)
    is applied and used to build your theme. It works similarly in a Maven
    workspace. See the 
    [Building Themes in a Maven Project](/docs/7-1/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/frameworks/building-themes-in-a-maven-project)
    article for more information.

Awesome! You know how WAR-style themes are built in workspace and where they
should reside.
