# Module JSP Override

[TOC levels=1-4]

The Module JSP Override sample conveys how to override an application's JSP by
leveraging OSGi fragment modules. This is not the recommended practice for
overriding JSPs in @product-ver@. See the
[Customizing JSPs](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/customizing-jsps)
article for better options.


This example overrides the default `login.jsp` file in the
`com.liferay.login.web` bundle by adding the red text *changed* to the Sign In
form.

## What API(s) and/or code components does this sample highlight?

This sample demonstrates how to create a fragment host module and configure it
to override an existing module's JSP.

## How does this sample leverage the API(s) and/or code component?

You can create your own JSP override by

- Declaring the fragment host.
- Providing the JSP that will override the original one.

To properly declare the fragment host in the `bnd.bnd` file, you must specify
the host module's (where the original JSP is located) Bundle Symbolic Name and
the host module's exact version to which the fragment belongs. In this example,
this is configured like this:

```
Fragment-Host: com.liferay.login.web;bundle-version="1.0.0"
```

Then you must provide the new JSP intended to override the original one. Be sure
to mimic the host module's folder structure when overriding its JAR. For this
example, since the original JSP is in the folder
`/META-INF/resources/login.jsp`, the new JSP file resides in the folder
`src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/login.jsp`.

If needed, you can also target the original JSP following one of the two
possible naming conventions: `original` or `portal`. This pattern looks like

```markup
<liferay-util:include
    page="/login.original.jsp"
    servletContext="<%= application %>"
/>
```

or

```markup
<liferay-util:include
    page="/login.portal.jsp"
    servletContext="<%= application %>"
/>
```

This approach can be used to override any application JSP (i.e., JSPs residing
in a module). You can also add new JSPs to an existing module with this
technique. For more information on other ways to customize JSPs, see the
[Customizing JSPs](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/customizing-jsps)
articles.

## Where Is This Sample?

There are three different versions of this sample, each built with a different
build tool:

- [Liferay Workspace](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-blade-samples/tree/7.2/liferay-workspace/overrides/module-jsp-override)
- [Maven](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-blade-samples/tree/7.2/maven/overrides/module-jsp-override)
