# Servlet

[TOC levels=1-4]

The Servlet sample provides an OSGi Whiteboard Servlet in @product@. When
deploying this sample and configuring the servlet, a *Hello World* message is
displayed when accessing the servlet page URL. Log info is also outputted to
your console.

To configure the servlet in @product@, complete the following steps:

1.  Navigate to the *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *Server
    Administration* &rarr; *Log Levels*.

2.  Select *Add Category*.

3.  Insert *com.liferay.blade.samples.servlet.BladeServlet* for the Logger Name
    and *INFO* for the Log Level.

4.  Navigate to the http://localhost:8080/o/blade/servlet URL.

## What API(s) and/or code components does this sample highlight?

This sample leverages the
[HttpServlet](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/servletapi/javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html)
API.

## How does this sample leverage the API(s) and/or code component?

To customize this sample, modify its
`com.liferay.blade.samples.servlet.BladeServlet` class. This class extends the
`HttpServlet` class. Creating your own servlet for @product@ is useful when you
need to implement servlet actions. For example, if you wanted to implement the
CMIS server by yourself with [Apache Chemistry](https://chemistry.apache.org/),
you would need to implement your own servlet, managing requests at a low level.
