# Liferay Faces

[TOC levels=1-4]

Liferay Faces is an umbrella project that provides support for the
JavaServer&#8482; Faces (JSF) standard within @product@. It encompasses the
following projects:

- [Liferay Faces Bridge](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/understanding-liferay-faces-bridge)
  enables you to deploy JSF web apps as portlets without writing
  portlet-specific Java code. It also contains innovative features that make it
  possible to leverage the power of JSF 2.x inside a portlet application.
  Liferay Faces Bridge implements the JSR 329 Portlet Bridge Standard. 
- [Liferay Faces Alloy](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/understanding-liferay-faces-alloy)
  enables you to use AlloyUI components in a way that is consistent with JSF
  development. 
- [Liferay Faces Portal](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/understanding-liferay-faces-portal)
  enables you to leverage Liferay-specific utilities and UI components in JSF
  portlets. 

In this section of reference documentation, you'll learn more about each of
these projects. You'll also learn about the Liferay Faces version scheme.
