# Workflow Notifications

[TOC levels=1-4]

While an asset is in a workflow, relevant Users should be notified about certain
events, like when a review task is completed. Any workflow node with an
`<actions>` element can have notifications.

```xml
<actions>
    <action>
        <notification>
            <name>Creator Modification Notification</name>
            <template>Your submission was rejected by ${userName}, please modify and resubmit.</template>
            <template-language>freemarker</template-language>
            <notification-type>email</notification-type>
            <notification-type>user-notification</notification-type>
            <execution-type>onAssignment</execution-type>
        </notification>
    </actions>
</actions>
```

The above Creator Modification Notification sends a notification message in two
ways: via email and via user notification (this goes to the Notifications widget
in the User's Site). The message is defined in a FreeMarker template and sent
once a task assignment is created. But who receives the notification? If no
recipients are explicitly specified via a `recipients` tag, the asset's creator
receives the notification.

## Notification Options

There are several elements that can be specified in a `<notification>`:

**Name**
: Set the name of the notification in the `<name>` element. This information is
used to display the notification in the _My Workflow Tasks_ widget of a User's
personal Site.

**Description**
: The `<description>` element contains the subject of the notification if the
notification type is `email`. The syntax is determined by the template language
you're using.

**Template**
: The `<template>` element contains the message of the notification. The syntax
is determined by the template language you're using.

**Template Language**
: Choose from `freemarker`, `velocity`, or plain `text` in the
`<template-language>` tag.

**Notification Type**
: Choose whether to send an `email`, `user-notification` (via the Notification
widget), `im` (instant message), or `private-message` in the
`<notification-type>` tag.

```xml
<notification-type>email</notification-type>
```

**Execution Type**
: Choose to link the sending of the notification to entry into the node
(`onEntry`), when a task is assigned (`onAssignment`), or when the workflow
processing is leaving a node (`onExit`). If you specify a notification to be
sent on assignment, the assignee is notified automatically.

**Recipients**
: Decide who should receive the notification in the `<recipients>` tag:

```xml
<recipients>
    [SEE BELOW FOR THE AVAILABLE RECIPIENT TAGS]
</recipients>
```

Available recipient tags are

- `<user>`: notify the User that sent the asset through the workflow.
  Specify the tag as `<user />`. To notify a specific user, enter the
  `userId`:

```xml
<recipients>
    <user />
</recipients>
<recipients>
    <user>
        <user-id>20139</user-id>
    </user>
</recipients>
```

- `<roles>`: notify specific Roles, either by ID or by their type and name.

```xml
<recipients>
    <roles>
        <role>
            <role-id>33621</role-id>
        </role>
    </roles>
</recipients>
<recipients>
    <roles>
        <role>
            <role-type>regular</role-type>
            <name>Power User</name>
            <auto-create>false</auto-create>
        </role>
    </roles>
</recipients>
```

- `<assignees />`: notify the task assignees.

- `<scripted-recipient>`: use a script to identify notification recipients.

```xml
<recipients>
    <scripted-recipient>
        <script>
            <![CDATA[Script logic goes here]]>
        </script>
        <script-language>groovy</script-language>
    </scripted-recipient>
</recipients>
```

If the notification type is `email`, you can specify the `recipientType`
attribute of the `<recipients>` tag as _To_, _CC_, or _BCC_.

```xml
<recipients receptionType="cc">
    <roles>
        <role>
            <role-type>regular</role-type>
            <name>Manager</name>
        </role>
    </roles>
</recipients>
```

By default, `recipientType` is `to`.
