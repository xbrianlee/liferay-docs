[TOC levels=1-4]

You have access to a powerful set of taglibs for creating commonly used UI
components in your apps, themes, and web content. The following taglibs are 
covered in this section:

- AUI: create common UI components such as forms, buttons, and more.

  charts, and much more.

  [Clay components](https://clayui.com/docs/components/alerts.html), 
  such as alerts, buttons, drop-down menus, form elements, and more for your 
  apps. 

- Frontend: create UI components commonly used throughout Portal's apps, such 
  as add menus, cards, management bars, and more.

- Liferay UI: create common UI components such as icons, tabs, and more.
  
- Liferay Util: load additional resources, define parameters, buffer content, 
  and more.

| **Note:** Each taglib is available as a FreeMarker macro, except for the Chart 
| taglib. The Chart taglib is **not** available as a FreeMarker macro. The 
| articles in this section provide the proper syntax to use for each macro. See 
| the 
| [FreeMarker Taglib Mappings reference](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/product-freemarker-macros) 
| for a complete list of the available FreeMarker taglib macros.
