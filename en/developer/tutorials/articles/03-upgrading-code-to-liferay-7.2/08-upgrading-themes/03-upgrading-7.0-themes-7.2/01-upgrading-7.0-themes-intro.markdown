[TOC levels=1-4]

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use the [Liferay JS Theme Toolkit](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-js-themes-toolkit/tree/master/packages) 
to upgrade a @product@ 7.0 theme to @product-ver@. As you upgrade this theme, 
you'll learn how to update metadata, theme templates, UI (including support for 
Bootstrap 4 and Lexicon 2.0.), and more using all the best practices and 
standards. Completing this tutorial prepares you for upgrading your own theme. 

Theme upgrades involve these steps:

-  Updating project metadata
-  Updating CSS
-  Updating theme templates
