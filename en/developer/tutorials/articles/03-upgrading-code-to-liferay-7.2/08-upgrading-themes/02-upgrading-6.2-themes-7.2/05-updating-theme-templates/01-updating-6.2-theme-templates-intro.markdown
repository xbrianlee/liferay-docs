# Updating 6.2 Theme Templates

[TOC levels=1-4]

@product@ 6.2 theme templates and @product-ver@ theme templates are essentially 
the same. Here are the main changes:

-   Velocity templates were deprecated in Liferay Portal CE 7.0 and are now 
    removed in favor of FreeMarker templates in @product@. Below are the key 
    reasons for this move: 

    -   FreeMarker is developed and maintained regularly, while Velocity is no 
        longer actively being developed.

    -   FreeMarker is faster and supports more sophisticated macros.

    -   FreeMarker supports using taglibs directly rather than requiring a 
        method to represent them. You can pass body content to them, parameters, 
        etc.

-   The Dockbar has been replaced and reorganized into a set of three distinct 
    menus:

    -  *The Product Menu*: Manage Site and page navigation, content, settings 
       and pages for the current Site, and navigate to user account settings, 
       etc.

    -  *The Control Menu*: Configure and add content to the page and view the 
        page in a simulation window. 

    -  *The User Personal Bar*: Display notifications and the user's avatar and 
        name. 

    ![Figure 1: The Dockbar was removed and must be replaced with the new Control Menu.](../../../../../images/upgrading-themes-dockbar.png) 

Start by converting your Velocity theme templates to FreeMarker. You can refer
to Apache's 
[FreeMarker documentation](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/ref.html) 
for help. Common @product@ FreeMarker variables and macros can be found in 
[`FTL_liferay.ftl`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/7.2.x/modules/apps/portal-template/portal-template-freemarker/src/main/resources/FTL_liferay.ftl)

The [Gulp `upgrade` task](running-the-upgrade-task-for-6.2-themes) reports the 
required theme template changes in the log. For example, here are the 6.2 to 7.0 
upgrade log and 7.0 to 7.1 upgrade logs for the Lunar Resort theme:

```bash
----------------------------------------------------------------

    <@liferay.control_menu /> for new admin controls.
    Warning: not all admin controls will be visible without 
    <@liferay.control_menu />
    Warning: ${theme} variable is no longer available in Freemarker
