Now you'll import your theme to use the Liferay JS Theme Toolkit. The Liferay JS 
Theme Toolkit provides several useful Gulp tasks for automating theme 
development and maintenance, including upgrading parts of the theme. 

Follow these steps to import your theme to use the Liferay JS Theme Toolkit:

1.  Run the command below to import your 6.2 theme to use the Liferay JS Theme 
    Toolkit:

    ```bash
    yo liferay-theme:import
    ```

2.  Provide the path (relative or absolute) to the 6.2 theme project's root 
    folder and press the *Enter* key to import the theme.

3.  Answer the prompts to configure the location to your @product-ver@ app 
    server.

Congratulations! Your development environment is set up to use the Liferay JS 
Theme Toolkit. Next, you'll start upgrading the theme.
