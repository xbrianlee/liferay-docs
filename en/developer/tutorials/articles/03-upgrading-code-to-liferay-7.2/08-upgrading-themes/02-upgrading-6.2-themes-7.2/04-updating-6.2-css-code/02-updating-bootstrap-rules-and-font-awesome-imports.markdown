@product-ver@ uses Bootstrap 4.3's CSS rule syntax. Font Awesome icons have been 
removed from base themes, so you should remove those stale imports if you have 
them. The Gulp `upgrade` task reports automatic CSS updates and suggests manual 
updates. For example, here is part of the task log for the Lunar Resort theme 
upgrade from 6.2 to 7.0. For each update performed and suggested, the task 
reports a file name and line number range:

```bash
----------------------------------------------------------------
 Bootstrap Upgrade (2 to 3)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Because Liferay Portal 7.0 uses Bootstrap 3, the default box model has been 
changed to box-sizing: border-box. So if you were using width or height, and 
padding together on an element, you may need to make changes, or those elements 
may have unexpected sizes.

File: src/css/_aui_variables.scss
    Line 5: "$white" has been removed
    Line 31: "$white" has been removed
File: src/css/_custom.scss
    Line 201: Padding no longer affects width or height, you may need to change 
    your rule (lines 201-227)
    Line 207: Padding no longer affects width or height, you may need to change 
    your rule (lines 207-226)
    Line 212: You would change height from "62px" to "82px"
    Line 305: Padding no longer affects width or height, you may need to change 
    your rule (lines 305-314)
    Line 308: You would change height from "39px" to "46px"
    Line 409: Padding no longer affects width or height, you may need to change 
    your rule (lines 409-418)
```

Follow these steps to update your theme's Bootstrap rules and Font Awesome 
imports:

1.  Since Bootstrap 3 adopted the `box-sizing: border-box` property for all 
    elements and pseudo-elements (e.g., `:before` and `:after`), padding no 
    longer affects dimensions. 
    [Bootstrap's documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#less-mixins-box-sizing) 
    describes the box sizing changes. Update the width and height for all CSS 
    rules that use padding. For example, examine the `height` value change in 
    this CSS rule for the Lunar Resort theme's `_custom.scss` file:

    Original:

    ```css
    #reserveBtn {
    	background-color: #00C4FB;
    	border-radius: 10px;
    	color: #FFF;
    	font-size: 1.5em;
    	height: 62px;
    	margin: 30px;
    	padding: 10px 0;
    	...
    }
    ```

    Updated:

    ```css
    #reserveBtn {
    	background-color: #00C4FB;
    	border-radius: 10px;
    	color: #FFF;
    	font-size: 1.5em;
    	height: 82px;
    	margin: 30px;
    	padding: 10px 0;
    	...
    }
    ```

    | **Note:** For individual elements, you can overwrite the 
    | `box-sizing:border-box` rule with `box-sizing:content-box`. 

2.  The following variables are removed in Bootstrap 4. Remove these variables 
    where they are used in the theme:

    ```scss
    $line-height-computed
    $padding-base-horizontal
    $padding-base-vertical
    $padding-large-horizontal
    $padding-large-vertical
    $padding-small-horizontal
    $padding-small-vertical
    $padding-xs-horizontal
    $padding-xs-vertical
    $gray-base
    $gray-darker
    $gray-dark
    $gray
    $gray-light
    $gray-lighter
    $brand-primary
    $brand-success
    $brand-info
    $brand-warning
    $brand-danger
    $state-success-text
    $state-success-bg
    $state-success-border
    $state-info-text
    $state-info-bg
    $state-info-border
    $state-warning-text
    $state-warning-bg
    $state-warning-border
    $state-danger-text
    $state-danger-bg
    $state-danger-border
    ```

    See the 
    [Migrating from 2.x to 3.0 guide](http://getbootstrap.com/migration/#migrating-from-2x-to-30) 
    for CSS rules that changed in Bootstrap 3. Likewise, you can refer to the 
    [Migrating to v4 guide](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/migration/) 
    for updating CSS rules to Bootstrap 4. 

3.  Font Awesome icons were removed from the theme and Font are now included as 
    a package dependency if you answer yes (y) to include Font Awesome during 
    the upgrade task. If you included the old imports in `_custom.scss`, they 
    must be removed:

    ```scss
    @import "aui/alloy-font-awesome/scss/mixins-alloy";
    @import "aui/alloy-font-awesome/scss/variables";
    ```

Great! The rules and imports are updated. You can update the responsiveness 
next.
