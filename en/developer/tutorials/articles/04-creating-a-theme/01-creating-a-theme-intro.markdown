# Creating a Theme

[TOC levels=1-4]

This tutorial takes you step-by-step through the process of creating a theme. 
You'll create a responsive theme for Liferay's Lunar Resort that demonstrates 
best practices and uses @product@'s theme tools, extensions, and mechanisms. 
Several example files are referenced throughout this tutorial. You can download 
the [`lunar-resort-theme.zip`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs/tree/master/en/developer/tutorials/code) 
if you want to follow along locally. The Lunar Resort theme's files are also 
included in the [`lunar-resort-theme`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs/tree/master/en/developer/tutorials/code/lunar-resort-theme) 
folder of the Liferay Docs repo, if you would rather view them there.

This tutorial covers these topics:

- Generating the theme and configuring it to extend the Atlas base theme 
- Customizing the Header and logo
- Customizing the Header navigation
- Customizing the Footer and embedding footer navigation
- Creating a color scheme variant

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to create the theme below:
