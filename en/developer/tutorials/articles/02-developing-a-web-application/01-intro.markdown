# Developing a Web Application

[TOC levels=1-4]

This tutorial shows you how to build a Liferay application from beginning to
end. Starting by designing the back-end using Liferay's object-relational mapper
Service Builder, you'll move from there to designing the widget that calls all
of those services. In the process, you'll learn about many of Liferay's
development frameworks, including 

- Permissions
- Search
- Assets
- REST Builder web services
- Workflow
- Staging

When you're finished, the application looks like this: 

![Figure 1: It looks humble, but there's a lot of functionality packed in this application.](../../images/finished-guestbook-intro.png)

This tutorial assumes nothing, so it starts at the beginning: setting up a 
Liferay development environment. Though you can use anything from a text editor 
and the command line to your Java IDE of choice, Liferay @ide@ optimizes
development on Liferay's platform. It integrates Liferay's Blade tools for
modular development. 

Once you have an environment ready, you'll jump right in and start creating your
object-relational map. After you've created your back-end, you'll move to the
front-end. 

From there you'll see everything from UI standards to providing remote 
services. Once everything is completed and wrapped up with a bow, you can 
distribute the application on Marketplace.
