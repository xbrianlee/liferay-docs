# Assets: Integrating with Liferay's Framework

[TOC levels=1-4]

The asset framework transforms entities into a common format that can be
published anywhere in your Site. Web content articles, blog posts, wiki
articles, and documents are some asset-enabled entities that come
out-of-the-box. By asset-enabling your own applications, you can take advantage
of @product@'s functionality for publishing your application's data across your
Site in the form of asset publisher entries, notifications, social activities,
and more. 

The asset framework includes these features:

- Tags and categories
- Comments and ratings
- Related assets (a.k.a. Asset links)
- Faceted search
- Integration with the Asset Publisher portlet
- Integration with the Search portlet
- Integration with the Tags Navigation, Tag Cloud, and Categories 
  Navigation portlets

Now you'll asset-enable the guestbook and guestbook entry entities. You'll
implement tags, categories, and related assets for guestbooks and guestbook
entries. You'll implement comments and ratings in guestbook entries. You'll also
learn how asset-enabled guestbooks and guestbook entries integrate with
core portlets like the Asset Publisher, Tags Navigation, Tag Cloud, and
Categories Navigation portlets. 

As always, [source code](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs/tree/master/en/developer/tutorials/code/guestbook/09-assets/com-liferay-docs-guestbook) is provided in case you get stuck.
