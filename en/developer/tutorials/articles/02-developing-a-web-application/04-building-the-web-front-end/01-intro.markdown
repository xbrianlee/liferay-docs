# Building the Web Front-End

[TOC levels=1-4]

You now have a back-end: you created a `service.xml` file to define your
application's data model, and generated the back-end code (the model, service,
and persistence layers) with Service Builder. You also added service methods
using the appropriate extension points: your entities' `*LocalServiceImpl`
classes. Now you can add a front-end to match new back-end, creating a fully
functional application. 

You'll create two portlets: the Guestbook portlet for users to use to add
entries and in a later step, a Guestbook Admin portlet for administrators to add
Guestbooks.

in case you get stuck.
