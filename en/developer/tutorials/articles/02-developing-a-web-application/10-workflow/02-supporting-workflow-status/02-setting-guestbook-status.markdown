# Setting the Guestbook Status

[TOC levels=1-4]

<div class="learn-path-step">
    <p>Supporting Workflow at the Service Layer<br>Step 1 of 3</p>
</div>

Before now, you set the status of all added guestbooks to approved in the
service layer. Now you'll set it to draft and pass it to the workflow framework. 

1.  From `guestbook-service`, open `GuestbookLocalServiceImpl` and add the
    status fields below the existing setter methods in the `addGuestbook`
    method:

    ```java
    guestbook.setStatus(WorkflowConstants.STATUS_DRAFT);
    guestbook.setStatusByUserId(userId);
    guestbook.setStatusByUserName(user.getFullName());
    guestbook.setStatusDate(serviceContext.getModifiedDate(null));
    ```

    This manually populates the status fields and sets the workflow status as
    a draft in the `GB_GuestbookEntry` database table. At this point they're
    identical to the similarly named non-status counterparts (like `setUserId`
    and `setStatusByUserId`), but they'll be updated independently in the
    `updateStatus` method you write later.

2.  Still in the `addGuestbook` method, place the following code right before
    the `return` statement:

    ```java
    WorkflowHandlerRegistryUtil.startWorkflowInstance(guestbook.getCompanyId(), 
                guestbook.getGroupId(), guestbook.getUserId(), Guestbook.class.getName(), 
                guestbook.getPrimaryKey(), guestbook, serviceContext);
    ```

    The call to `startWorkflowInstance` detects whether workflow is installed
    and enabled. If it isn't, the added entity is automatically marked as
    approved. The `startWorkflowInstance` call also calls your
    `GuestbookWorkflowHandler` class, which you'll create later. 

3.  Organize imports (*[CTRL]+[SHIFT]+O*), and save your work.

The `startWorkflowInstance` method is where your entity enters the workflow
framework, but you're not finished yet. Just like you wouldn't drop your child
off at college and then change your number and move to a new address, you're
not going to abandon your `Guestbook` entity (yet). 

## Creating the updateStatus Method

Exert control over how the status fields are updated in the database.

1.  Create an `updateStatus` method in `GuestbookLocalServiceImpl`, immediately
    following the `deleteGuestbook` method. Here's the first half of it:

    ```java
    public Guestbook updateStatus(long userId, long guestbookId, int status,
			ServiceContext serviceContext) throws PortalException,
			SystemException {

		User user = userLocalService.getUser(userId);
		Guestbook guestbook = getGuestbook(guestbookId);

		guestbook.setStatus(status);
		guestbook.setStatusByUserId(userId);
		guestbook.setStatusByUserName(user.getFullName());
		guestbook.setStatusDate(new Date());

		guestbookPersistence.update(guestbook);
    ```

    If this method is called, it's because your entity is returning from the
    workflow framework, and it's time to update the status values in the database.
    Set the status fields, then persist the updated entity to the database. 
 
2.  Before saving, finish the method:

    ```java
		if (status == WorkflowConstants.STATUS_APPROVED) {

			assetEntryLocalService.updateVisible(Guestbook.class.getName(),
					guestbookId, true);

		} else {

			assetEntryLocalService.updateVisible(Guestbook.class.getName(),
					guestbookId, false);
		}

		return guestbook;
	}
    ```

    This `if` statement determines the visibility of the asset based on its workflow
    status. If it's approved, the `assetEntryLocalService.updateVisible` method sets
    the guestbook in question to `true` so it can be displayed in the Asset
    Publisher and in the search results. Otherwise (`else`) it sets the visibility
    to `false` to ensure that unapproved guestbooks aren't displayed to users in the
    Asset Publisher or the Search portlet.

3.  There's one more update to make in the `deleteGuestbook` method. When
    deleting, you must clean up the workflow system's database tables to avoid
    leaving orphaned entries when the backing entity is deleted. Before making
    the method call, open `service.xml` and add the following tag below the
    existing `<reference>` tags in the `Guestbook` entity:

    ```xml
    <reference entity="WorkflowInstanceLink" package-path="com.liferay.portal" />
    ```

4.  Back in `GuestbookLocalServiceImpl`, find the `deleteGuestbook` method and
    put this method call right before the `return` statement:

    ```java
    workflowInstanceLinkLocalService.deleteWorkflowInstanceLinks(
        guestbook.getCompanyId(), guestbook.getGroupId(),
        Guestbook.class.getName(), guestbook.getGuestbookId());
    ```

5.  Organize imports (*[CTRL]+[SHIFT]+O*) and save your work. Then run the
    `buildService` Gradle task. It injects the
    `WorkflowInstanceLinkLocalService` service into a protected variable in
    `GuesbookLocalServiceBaseImpl`. Since `GuestbookLocalServiceImpl` extends
    the base class, you can use it directly.

6.  Run *Refresh Gradle Project*. 

Now the guestbook entity's service layer populates the status fields in the
database, sends the entity into the workflow framework, and cleans up when it's
deleted. You'll do the same thing for guestbook entries next.
