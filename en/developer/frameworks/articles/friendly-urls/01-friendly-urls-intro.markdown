# Friendly URLs

[TOC levels=1-4]

This is a story of two URLs who couldn't be more different. One was full of
himself and always wanted to show everyone (users and SEO services alike) just
how smart he was by openly displaying all the parameters he carried. He was
happiest when he could tell people he met were intimidated and confused by him.

The other was just, well, friendly. She was less concerned about looking smart
and more concerned about those she interacted with, so she shared only the
important things about her. She didn't need to look fancy and complicated. She
aspired to be simple and kind to all the users and SEO services she
encountered.

If you want your application to be friendly to your users and to SEO services,
make your URLs friendlier. It only takes a couple steps, after all.
