# Frameworks

[TOC levels=1-4]

To make your applications more fully featured and to develop them faster, you
can make use of Liferay's development frameworks. These help you create
commonly used features---like search, tagging, and comments---without having to
develop them from scratch. And since these features are tried and tested, you
can rest assured knowing they're bug free. 

Here are just a few frameworks you'll find here: 

[**A fully-fledged permissions system:**](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/defining-application-permissions) 
Implement permissions the way they're
implemented with the applications that ship with @product@ for a consistent,
seamless, and robust experience. 

[**Assets:**](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/asset-framework) 
Publish data from your application across the system, making it
available to those who need it, and enabling other features like tagging,
categorizing, and comments. 

[**Search:**](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/search) 
If you have a data-driven application, you can add search
capabilities by integrating with Liferay's search indexer. 

[**A configuration system with auto-generated or custom UI:**](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/configurable-applications) 
Are you providing user-configurable options in your application? Make use of
Liferay's configuration system and provide a clean and consistent experience
for your users. 

[**File management:**](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/documents-and-media-api) 
Will your applications work with files? Use Liferay's Documents and Media API
to manage them. 

[**Import/Export:**](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/content-publication-management) 
Use Liferay's import/export system to make your application's
data portable or to stage it for publication to production systems. 

[**Web Fragments:**](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/page-fragments) 
Provide your content managers with dynamic chunks of
functionality they can use as building blocks for web pages. 

[**Workflow:**](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/the-workflow-framework) 
Run the data from your application through an approval process. 

This really just scratches the surface. From 
[pop-up list selectors](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/item-selector) to a [social
networking API](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/social-api), 
as a Liferay developer, you have access to tons of frameworks
that make your life easier.
