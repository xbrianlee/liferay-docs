# Deleting File Shortcuts

[TOC levels=1-4]

To delete a file shortcut with the Documents and Media API, you must use the 
`deleteFileShortcut` method discussed in 
[Deleting Entities](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/deleting-entities). 
The steps here show you how. For general information on using the API, see 
[Documents and Media API](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/documents-and-media-api). 

Follow these steps to delete a file shortcut: 

1.  Get a reference to `DLAppService`: 

    ```java
    @Reference
    private DLAppService _dlAppService;
    ```

2.  Get the file shortcut's ID. Since it's common to delete a file shortcut 
    specified by the end user, you can extract its ID from the request. This 
    example does so via `javax.portlet.ActionRequest` and 
    [`ParamUtil`](@platform-ref@/7.2-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/portal/kernel/util/ParamUtil.html), 
    but you can do this any way you wish: 

    ```java
    long fileShortcutId = ParamUtil.getLong(actionRequest, "fileShortcutId");
    ```

3.  Use the service reference to call the `deleteFileShortcut` method with the 
    file shortcut ID from the previous step: 

    ```java
    _dlAppService.deleteFileShortcut(fileShortcutId);
    ```

You can find the full code for this example in the `deleteFileShortcut` method 
of @product@'s 
[`EditFileShortcutMVCActionCommand`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/modules/apps/document-library/document-library-web/src/main/java/com/liferay/document/library/web/internal/portlet/action/EditFileShortcutMVCActionCommand.java) 
class. This class uses the Documents and Media API to implement almost all the 
`FileShortcut` actions that the Documents and Media app supports. Also note that 
this `deleteFileShortcut` method, as well as the rest of 
`EditFileShortcutMVCActionCommand`, contains additional logic to suit the 
specific needs of the Documents and Media app.
