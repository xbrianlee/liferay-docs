# JAX-WS

[TOC levels=1-4]

Liferay supports 
[JAX-WS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_XML_Web_Services) 
via the [Apache CXF](http://cxf.apache.org/) implementation. Apps can publish
JAX-WS web services to the CXF endpoints defined in your Liferay instance. CXF
endpoints are effectively context paths the JAX-WS web services are deployed to
and accessible from. To publish any kind of JAX-WS web service, one or more CXF
endpoints must be defined. To access JAX-WS web services, an *extender* must
also be configured in your Liferay instance. Extenders specify where the
services are deployed and whether they are augmented with handlers, providers,
and so on. 

**SOAP Extenders:** Required to publish JAX-WS web services. Each SOAP extender
can deploy the services to one or more CXF endpoints and can use a set of
[JAX-WS handlers](https://jax-ws.java.net/articles/handlers_introduction.html)
to augment the services. 

SOAP extenders are subsystems that track the services the app developer
registers in OSGi (those matching the provided 
[OSGi filters](https://osgi.org/javadoc/r6/core/org/osgi/framework/Filter.html)), 
and deploy them under the specified CXF endpoints. For example, if you create 
the CXF endpoint `/soap`, you could later create a SOAP extender for `/soap` 
that publishes SOAP services. Of course, this is only a rough example: you can 
fine tune things to your liking. 

CXF endpoints and extenders can be created programmatically or with Liferay's
Control Panel. This tutorial shows you how to do both, and then shows you how to
publish JAX-WS web services. The following topics are covered:

- [Configuring Endpoints and Extenders with the Control Panel](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/jax-ws#configuring-endpoints-and-extenders-with-the-control-panel)

- [Configuring Endpoints and Extenders Programmatically](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/jax-ws#configuring-endpoints-and-extenders-programmatically)

- [Publishing JAX-WS Web Services](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/jax-ws#publishing-jax-ws-web-services)

## Configuring Endpoints and Extenders with the Control Panel

Liferay's Control Panel lets administrators configure endpoints and extenders
for JAX-WS web services. Note that you must be an administrator in your Liferay
instance to access the settings here. First, you'll learn how to create CXF
endpoints. 

To configure a CXF endpoint with the Control Panel, first go to *Control Panel*
&rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings* &rarr; *Web API*. Then select
*CXF Endpoints* from the list. If there are any existing CXF endpoints, they're
shown here. To add a new one, click the *Add* button. The form that appears
lets you configure a new CXF endpoint by filling out these fields: 

**Context Path:** The path the JAX-WS web services are deployed to on the
Liferay server. For example, if you define the context path `/web-services`, any
services deployed there are available at
`http://your-server:your-port/o/web-services`. 

**`AuthVerifier` properties:** Any properties defined here are passed as-is to 
the `AuthVerifier` filter. See the 
[`AuthVerifier` documentation](/docs/7-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/authentication-verifiers) 
for more details. 

**Required Extensions:** CXF normally loads its default extension classes, but 
in some cases you can override them to replace the default behavior. In most
cases, you can leave this field blank: overriding extensions isn't common. By
specifying custom extensions here via [OSGi filters](https://osgi.org/javadoc/r6/core/org/osgi/framework/Filter.html), 
Liferay waits until those extensions are registered in the OSGi framework 
before creating the CXF servlet and passing the extensions to the servlet.

For an app to deploy JAX-WS web services, you must configure a SOAP extender.
To configure a SOAP extender with the Control Panel, first go to *Control
Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings* &rarr; *Web API*. Then
select *SOAP Extenders* from the list. If there are any existing SOAP
extenders, they're shown here. To add a new one, click on the *Add* button. The
form that appears lets you configure a new SOAP extender by filling out these
fields: 

**Context paths:** Specify at least one CXF endpoint here. This is where the 
services affected by this extender are deployed. In the preceding CXF endpoint 
example, this would be `/web-services`. Note that you can specify more than 
one CXF endpoint here. 

**jax.ws.handler.filters:** Here you can specify a set of 
[OSGi filters](https://osgi.org/javadoc/r6/core/org/osgi/framework/Filter.html) 
that select certain services registered in the OSGi framework. The selected 
services should implement JAX-WS handlers and augment the JAX-WS services 
specified in the *jax.ws.service.filters* property. These JAX-WS handlers 
apply to each service selected in this extender. 

**jax.ws.service.filters:** Here you can specify a set of OSGi filters that
select the services registered in the OSGi framework that are deployed to the
CXF endpoints. These OSGi services must be 
[proper JAX-WS services](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/jaxws001.htm). 

**soap.descriptor.builder:** Leave this option empty to use JAX-WS annotations 
to describe the SOAP service. To use a different way to describe the SOAP 
service, you can provide an OSGi filter here that selects an implementation of 
`com.liferay.portal.remote.soap.extender.SoapDescriptorBuilder`.

Next, you'll learn how to create endpoints and extenders programmatically. 

## Configuring Endpoints and Extenders Programmatically

To configure endpoints or extenders programmatically, you must use Liferay's 
configurator extender. The configurator extender provides a way for OSGi modules 
to deploy default configuration values. Modules that use the configurator 
extender must provide a `ConfigurationPath` header that points to the 
configuration files' location inside the module. For example, the following
configuration sets the `ConfigurationPath` to
`src/main/resources/configuration`:

```properties
Bundle-Name: Liferay Export Import Service JAX-WS
Bundle-SymbolicName: com.liferay.exportimport.service.jaxws
Bundle-Version: 1.0.0
Liferay-Configuration-Path: /configuration
Include-Resource: configuration=src/main/resources/configuration
Liferay-Releng-Module-Group-Description:
Liferay-Releng-Module-Group-Title: Data Management
```

Note that Liferay-specific Bnd instructions are prefixed with `Liferay` to
avoid conflicts. 

There are two different configuration types in 
[OSGi's `ConfigurationAdmin`](https://osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/service/cm/ConfigurationAdmin.html): 
single, and factory. Factory configurations can have several configuration 
instances per factory name. @product@ uses factory configurations. You 
must provide a factory configuration's default values in a `*.properties` file. 
In this properties file, use a suffix on the end of the PID (persistent 
identifier) and then provide your settings. For example, the following code uses 
the `-staging` suffix on the PID and creates a CXF endpoint at the context path 
`/staging-ws`: 

`com.liferay.portal.remote.cxf.common.configuration.CXFEndpointPublisherConfiguration-staging.properties`:

```properties
contextPath=/staging-ws
```

As another example, the following code uses the suffix `-stagingjaxws` on the 
PID and creates a SOAP extender at the context path `/staging-ws`. This code 
also includes settings for the configuration fields `jaxWsHandlerFilterStrings` 
and `jaxWsServiceFilterStrings`: 

`com.liferay.portal.remote.soap.extender.configuration.SoapExtenderConfiguration-stagingjaxws.properties`:

```properties
contextPaths=/staging-ws
jaxWsHandlerFilterStrings=(staging.jax.ws.handler=true)
jaxWsServiceFilterStrings=(staging.jax.ws.service=true)
```

You must then use these configuration fields in the configuration class. For 
example, the `SoapExtenderConfiguration` interface below contains the 
configuration fields `contextPaths`, `jaxWsHandlerFilterStrings`, and 
`jaxWsServiceFilterStrings`: 

```java
@ExtendedObjectClassDefinition(
    category = "foundation", factoryInstanceLabelAttribute = "contextPaths"
)
@Meta.OCD(
    factory = true,
    id = "com.liferay.portal.remote.soap.extender.configuration.SoapExtenderConfiguration",
    localization = "content/Language", name = "soap.extender.configuration.name"
)
public interface SoapExtenderConfiguration {

    @Meta.AD(required = false)
    public String[] contextPaths();

    @Meta.AD(name = "jax.ws.handler.filters", required = false)
    public String[] jaxWsHandlerFilterStrings();

    @Meta.AD(name = "jax.ws.service.filters", required = false)
    public String[] jaxWsServiceFilterStrings();

    @Meta.AD(name = "soap.descriptor.builder", required = false)
    public String soapDescriptorBuilderFilter();

}
```

Next, you'll learn how to publish JAX-WS web services. 

## Publishing JAX-WS Web Services

To publish JAX-WS web services via SOAP in a module, annotate the class and its
methods with standard JAX-WS annotations, and then register it as a service in
the OSGi framework. For example, the following class uses the `@WebService`
annotation for the class and `@WebMethod` annotations for its methods. You must
also set the `jaxws` property to `true` in the OSGi `@Component` annotation: 

```java
import javax.jws.WebMethod;
import javax.jws.WebService;

import org.osgi.service.component.annotations.Component;

@Component(
    immediate = true, property = "jaxws=true", service = Calculator.class
)
@WebService
public class Calculator {

    @WebMethod
    public int divide(int a, int b) {
        return a / b;
    }

    @WebMethod
    public int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }

    @WebMethod
    public int subtract(int a, int b) {
        return a - b;
    }

    @WebMethod
    public int sum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

}
```

You should also make sure that you include `org.osgi.core` and 
`org.osgi.service.component.annotations` as dependencies to your project.
