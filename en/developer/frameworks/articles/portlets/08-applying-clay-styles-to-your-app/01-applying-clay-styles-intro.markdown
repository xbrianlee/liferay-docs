# Applying Clay Styles to your App

[TOC levels=1-4]

It's important to have a consistent user experience across your apps. 
Portal's built-in apps achieve this through Liferay's 
[Lexicon Experience Language](https://liferay.design/lexicon/) and its web 
implementation, [Clay](https://clayui.com/docs/getting-started/clay.html). 

Clay provides a consistent, user-friendly UI and is included in all themes that 
are based on the `_styled` base theme, making all the components documented on 
the [Clay site](https://clayui.com/docs/components/alerts.html) accessible.

This means you can use Clay markup and components in your apps. This section 
explains how to apply Clay's design patterns to achieve the same look and feel 
as Portal's built-in apps. 

This section covers these topics:

- Applying Clay to navigation
- Implementing the Management Toolbar
