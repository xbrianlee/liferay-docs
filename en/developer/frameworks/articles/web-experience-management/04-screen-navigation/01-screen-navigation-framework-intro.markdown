# Screen Navigation Framework

[TOC levels=1-4]

The Screen Navigation Framework is for customizing and extending application
UIs. You can use it to make Liferay's applications your own and to make your
applications customizable by others. 

The framework uses a specific structure for screens and supports one or two 
levels of navigation. Each item in the top level navigation is a 
`ScreenNavigationCategory`. Each item in the second level is a 
`ScreenNavigationEntry`. Categories are usually represented by tabs, while
entries use a second level of navigation. You need not have any Entries in your
application, but you must have at least one Category.

![Figure 1: The User Management application has three Screen Navigation Categories: General, Contact, and Preference; and each of those have a number of Screen Navigation Entries](../../../images/screen-nav-sample-screen-1.png)

The Screen structure normally renders Navigation Categories as horizontal tabs
at the top of the page and Navigation Entries as a vertical list of items along
the left side of the page. The screen box containing the content uses the rest
of the screen. You can customize this default layout for your needs.

![Figure 2: Many application only use Screen Navigation Categories for their functionality, and don't have Screen Navigation Entries. For Blogs, Entries and Images are Categories with no Entries.](../../../images/screen-nav-one-level.png)

## Using the Framework for Your Application 

The Screen Navigation Framework comprises two parts: Java classes for your
screens and a tag library for your front-end. To use Screen Navigation for your
application, first you'll create the necessary Java classes and then add the 
front-end support through JSPs.

Your `ScreenNavigationCategory` class must be a a component that implements the 
`ScreenNavigationCategory` interface with these methods:

**`getCategoryKey()`**: returns the category's primary key.

**`getLabel(Locale locale)`**: returns the label of the key.

**`getScreenNavigationKey()`**: returns the navigation key that the 
category belongs in, as defined in your application.

Your `ScreenNavigationEntry` class, similarly must be a component which 
implements `ScreenNavigationEntry` with the following methods:

**`getCategoryKey()`**: returns the category's primary key.

**`getEntryKey()`**: returns the entry's primary key.

**`getLabel()`**: returns the entries label.

**`getScreenNavigationKey()`**: returns the navigation key for the category 
of the current entry.

**`isVisible(User user, T screenModelBean)`**: boolean for whether or not 
the entry should be visible for the current user.

**`render(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)`**: 
renders the entry. The `render` method is also where any logic for creating
the configuration goes.

## Adding Custom Screens to Liferay Applications 

You can extend certain Liferay Applications with custom screens. Custom screens 
can add configuration for features you've developed and added to a Liferay 
application, integrating them seamlessly with the original application.

The parameters it needs are `key`, `modelBean`, and `portletURL`.

* **Key**: a unique name for the navigation in this application.

* **modelBean**: the model that is being rendered

* **portletURL**: the portlet URL used to build the titles for each link.

In addition to these parameters, you must build the page that users will use
for configuration, and connect it to your business logic through the render 
command.
