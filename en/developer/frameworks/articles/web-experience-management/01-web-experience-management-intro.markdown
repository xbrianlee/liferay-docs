# Web Experience Management

[TOC levels=1-4]

Web Experience Management encompasses Liferay's features and tools for building
Sites and creating content. Many of these, like Web Content Management and Page
Templates, are graphical tools used by administrators and marketers. Others,
like Page Fragments, let web developers flex their muscles in content
creation. These articles cover where web development intersects with user
experience and how to use Liferay's Web Experience frameworks to integrate
custom applications into @product@.
