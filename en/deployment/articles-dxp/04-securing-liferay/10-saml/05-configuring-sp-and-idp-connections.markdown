# Changing the Settings for Service Provider and Identity Provider Connections

[TOC levels=1-4]

To change the SAML Service Provider Settings, navigate to the Service Provider
tab. 

The Service Provider tab includes these options:

**Require Assertion Signature?:** Check this box to require SAML assertions
to be individually signed in addition to the entire SAML message.

| **Note:** Individual assertions need not be signed as long as the SAML response
| itself is signed. The SP and IdP should always communicate over `https` to have
| encryption at the transport level.
| 
| If you believe man-in-the-middle attacks are possible, the SAML response can be
| signed. The only reason to sign the assertions is if the SAML response is not
| signed. In this case, assertions should not only be signed but also encrypted.

**Clock Skew:** Clock skew is a tolerance in milliseconds used by the Service
Provider for mitigating time differences between the clocks of the Identity
Provider and the Service Provider. This usually only matters when assertions
have been made to expire very quickly.

**LDAP Import Enabled:** Check this box to import user information from the
configured LDAP connection based on the resolved `NameID`. LDAP connections can be
configured from Instance Settings.

**Sign Authn Requests:** Check this box to sign the `AuthnRequest` even if the
Identity Provider metadata indicates that it's not required.

**Sign Metadata:** Check this box to sign the metadata XML file.

**SSL Required:** Check this box to reject SAML messages that are not sent
over HTTPS. This does not affect how URLs are generated.

## Changing the SAML Identity Provider Connection Settings

To configure @product@'s SAML Identity Provider Settings, navigate to the
Identity Provider Connection tab of the SAML Admin portlet and click the *Edit*
action button on the IdP you want to configure. 

**Name:** The name of the Identity Provider with which to connect.

**Entity ID:** The Identity Provider's entity ID. This value must match the
entity ID declared in the Identity Provider metadata.

**Enabled:** Check the box to enable this IdP. 

**Clock Skew:** Clock skew is a tolerance in milliseconds used by the Service
Provider for mitigating time differences between the clocks of the Identity
Provider and the Service Provider. This usually only matters when assertions
have been made to expire very quickly.

**Force Authn:** Check this box to have the Service Provider ask the Identity
Provider to re-authenticate the user before verifying the user.

**Metadata:** You can provide a URL to the Identity Provider metadata XML file
or you can manually upload it. If you provide a URL, the XML file is
automatically retrieved and periodically polled for updates. You can change the
update interval in System Settings by modifying the Runtime Metadata Refresh
Interval property which specifies a number of seconds. If fetching the metadata
XML file by URL fails, you can't enable the Identity Provider connection. If the
metadata is inaccessible via URL, you can upload the XML file manually. In this
case, the metadata XML file is not updated automatically. 

**Name Identifier Format:** Choose the Name Identifier Format used in the SAML
Response. Set this according to what the Service Provider expects to receive.
For Liferay Service Providers, selections other than email address indicate
that the Name Identifier refers to screen name. The formats don't have any
special meaning to Liferay Identity Providers. The Name Identifier attribute
defines the `NameID` value.

**Attribute Mapping:** Attribute mapping is done from the attribute name or
friendly name in the SAML Response to the @product@ attribute name. For example,
if you want to map a response attribute named `mail` to the @product@ attribute
`emailAddress`, enter the following mapping:

    mail=emailAddress

Available @product@ attributes are: `emailAddress`, `screenName`, `firstName`,
`lastName`, `modifiedDate`, and `uuid`.

**Keep Alive URL:** If users are logged into several @product@ SP instances via
a @product@ IdP, their sessions can be kept alive as long as they keep a browser
window open to one of them. Configure this only if the IdP is @product@. The URL
is `https://[IdP host name]/c/portal/saml/keep_alive`. On the @product@ IdP,
configure this URL the same way, but point back to this SP. 

Save your changes when you are finished configuring the @product@ instance as a
service provider. There is no need to restart the server: the changes are
applied immediately.

Make the above configurations through the SAML Control Panel interface and not
via properties. Some features of the Liferay Connector to SAML 2.0 app are not
available as properties.

| **Limitation:** The Liferay SAML app can only be used with a single virtual
| host. Technically, this means that in the SAML metadata for @product@, only one
| binding can be added in this form:
| 
| ```xml
| <md:EntityDescriptor>
| ...
| <md:SPSSODescriptor>
| ...
| <md:AssertionConsumerService Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST" Location="https://portal.domain.com/c/portal/saml/acs" index="1" isDefault="true" />
| ...
| </md:SPSSODescriptor>
| </md:EntityDescriptor>
