# Managing Liferay DXP with Liferay Connected Services

[TOC levels=1-4]

Liferay Connected Services (LCS) is a set of tools and services for managing and
monitoring your @product@ instances. LCS can help you install fix packs, monitor
your instances' performance, activate your instances, and help you manage your
subscriptions. In other words, LCS is like a butler for the mansion that is
@product@. It's like having a single butler that can serve several mansions at once! 

| **Note:** LCS is deprecated and will be shut down on December 31, 2021. 
| Customers who activate LCS are advised to replace it with our latest activation
| key type which is suitable for virtualized environments.
