[TOC levels=1-4]

<aside class="alert alert-info">
  <span class="wysiwyg-color-blue120">This document has been updated and ported to <a href="https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/installation-and-upgrades/upgrading-liferay/reference/maintenance-mode-and-deprecations-in-7-2.html">Liferay Learn</a> and is no longer maintained here.</span>

During the development of any software product, it's sometimes necessary to stop
development on or remove outdated or unpopular features. @product-ver@ is no
different. In @product-ver@, Liferay has deprecated several apps and features.

There are three types of deprecated apps:

1.  Deprecated apps that remain in @product@, but will be removed in a future
    release. (Availability: *Bundled*)

2.  Deprecated apps that have been removed from @product@, yet are still
    available for download via [Liferay
    Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace) (Availability:
    *Marketplace*)

3.  Deprecated apps that have been removed from @product@ and aren't available
    for download. (Availability: *Removed*)

| **Note:** All apps deprecated by Liferay are no longer in active development.
| You should therefore plan to stop using these apps. Such apps, however, may
| still be available for download.

| **Note:** For information on apps deprecated in @product@ 7.1, please see
| [Deprecated Apps in 7.1: What to Do](/docs/7-1/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/deprecated-apps-in-7-1-what-to-do)
