As @product@ evolves so do Liferay applications. They may, for example, be
deprecated in favor of newer and better Liferay applications. The deprecations
might call for migrating application data to a new application or completely
removing the application and data. Before upgrading, examine the deprecations:

-   [7.2 deprecations](/docs/7-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/deprecated-apps-in-7-2-what-to-do)

-   [7.1 deprecations](/docs/7-1/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/deprecated-apps-in-7-1-what-to-do)

Determine how and when to address the deprecations in your upgrade plan.
