Upgrading to @product-ver@ involves migrating your installation and [code (your
theme and custom
apps)](/docs/7-2/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/upgrading-code-to-product-ver) to
the new version. Here you'll learn how to upgrade your installation.

Here are the installation upgrade paths:

| Upgrade Path                                   | Description                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Liferay Portal 5.x and 6.0.x &rarr; Liferay Portal 6.2 &rarr; @product@ 7.2 | Support life ended for Liferay Portal 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, and 6.0 |
| Liferay Portal 6.1.x &rarr; @product@ 7.1 &rarr; @product@ 7.2      | Support life ended for Liferay Portal 6.1 |
| Liferay Portal 6.2+ &rarr; @product@ 7.2       |                            |
| @product@ 7.0+ &rarr; @product@ 7.2            |                            |

| **Note:** Themes and custom apps from Liferay Portal 6.0 through @product@ 
| 7.1 can be upgraded directly to @product@ 7.2. See the
| [code upgrade instructions](/docs/7-2/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/upgrading-code-to-product-ver)
| for details. 

Here are the upgrade steps: 

| **Note:** You can 
| [prepare a new Liferay server for data upgrade](/docs/7-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/preparing-to-upgrade-the-product-database)
| in parallel with the steps up to and including the step to
| [upgrading the @product@ data](/docs/7-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/upgrading-the-product-data).
