LDAP is a common user store for @product@. You can configure LDAP at the
system scope in System Settings or at the instance scope in Instance settings.
Users can be imported from LDAP or exported to LDAP. To access LDAP
configuration settings, navigate to *Control Panel &rarr; Configuration* &rarr;
*Instance Settings*. At the bottom of the list on the left, click *Servers*. 

Click the *Add* button to add an LDAP server connection. If you have more than
one LDAP server, you can arrange the servers by order of preference using the
up/down arrows. Regardless of how many LDAP servers you add, each server has the
same configuration options.

**Server Name:** Enter a name for your LDAP server.

**Default Values:** Several common directory servers appear here. If you
use one of these, select it. The rest of the form is populated with default
values for that directory.

## Connection

These settings cover the connection to LDAP.

**Base Provider URL:** The link to the LDAP server. Make sure the @product@ server
can communicate with the LDAP server. If there is a firewall between the two
systems, make sure the appropriate ports are opened.

**Base DN:** The Base Distinguished Name for your LDAP directory. It is
usually modeled after your organization. It may look similar to this:
`dc=companynamehere,dc=com`.

**Principal:** The default LDAP administrator user ID is populated here. If your
administrator ID differs, use that credential instead. You need an
administrative credential because @product@ uses this ID to synchronize
user accounts to and from LDAP.

**Credentials:** This is the password for the LDAP administrative user.

This is all you need to make a regular connection to an LDAP directory. The rest
of the configuration, however, may need to be customized, as it represents "best
guesses" as to correct defaults. The default attribute mappings usually provide
enough data to synchronize back to the @product@ database when a user attempts
to log in. To test the connection to your LDAP server, click the *Test LDAP
Connection* button.

## Checkpoint

Before proceeding to fine tune @product@'s LDAP connections, ensure the
following steps have been taken:

1.  The LDAP connection is enabled. Depending on your needs, LDAP authentication
    may be required so that only users who have been bound may log in.

2.  *Export/Import*: for users in a clustered environment, Enable Import/Export
    on Startup should be disabled so that there are no massive imports on every
    node upon start up. 

3.  When adding the LDAP server, the *Server Name*, *Default Values*,
    *Connection* values are correct. It is always a good idea to click the *Test
    LDAP Connection* before saving.

## Instance Settings vs. System Settings

You can define an LDAP server connection at the System Settings scope as well.
Because this user interface is auto-generated, it's not as helpful as the one in
Instance Settings. For this reason, you should define and troubleshoot your
settings in Instance Settings first. If you decide you want your LDAP connection
at the system scope, you can copy your configuration from Instance Settings and
then delete the server from Instance Settings. 

Of course, you can also configure LDAP servers at the system scope using OSGi
`.config` files. The easiest way to do this is to use the GUI and export the
configuration. Then you can use the resulting `.config` file anywhere you need
it (such as other nodes in a cluster). 

**Note:** To use `config` files for LDAP server configuration, you must
specify the Virtual Instance ID (in the source, the variable name is
`companyId`) in the exported configuration file, because servers are defined
at the instance scope, not the system scope. To do this, specify the virtual
instance ID somewhere in the file like this: 

```properties
companyId=1234
```
You can find your Virtual Instance ID in Control Panel &rarr; Configuration
&rarr; Virtual Instances.

## Security

If you run your LDAP directory in SSL mode to encrypt credential information on
the network, you must perform extra steps to share the encryption key and
certificate between the two systems.

For example, if your LDAP directory is Microsoft Active Directory on
Windows Server 2003, you'd share the certificate like this:

Click *Start* &rarr; *Administrative Tools* &rarr; *Certificate Authority*.
Highlight the machine that is the certificate authority, right-click on it, and
click *Properties*. From the General menu, click *View Certificate*. Select the
Details view, and click *Copy To File*. Use the resulting wizard to save the
certificate as a file. You must also import the certificate into the *cacerts
keystore* like this: 

    keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore /some/path/java-8-jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt -alias MyRootCA -file /some/path/MyRootCA.cer

The `keytool` utility ships as part of the Java SDK.

Once this is done, go back to the LDAP page in the Control Panel. Modify the
LDAP URL in the Base DN field to the secure version by changing the protocol to
`ldaps` and the port to `636` like this:

    ldaps://myLdapServerHostname:636

Save the changes. Communication to LDAP is now encrypted. 

## Configuring LDAP Import/Export

The other settings configure mappings between LDAP and @product@ so users and
groups can be imported. 

### Users

This section contains settings for finding users in your LDAP directory.

**Authentication Search Filter:** Use this search filter box to determine
the search criteria for user logins. By default, @product@ uses users' email
addresses for their login names. The value here must use the authentication
method you use. For example, if you changed @product@'s authentication method to
use screen names instead of the email addresses, you would modify the search
filter so it can match the entered log in name:

    (cn=@screen_name@)

**Import Search Filter:** Depending on the LDAP schema, there are different
ways to identify the user. The default setting is usually fine:

    (objectClass=inetOrgPerson)

If you want to search for only a subset of users or users that have
different LDAP object classes, you can change this.

**User Mapping:** Next, you can define mappings from LDAP attributes to Liferay
fields. Though LDAP user attributes may be different from LDAP server to LDAP
server, there are five fields @product@ requires to be mapped for the user
to be recognized:

-   *Screen Name* (e.g., `uid` or `cn`)
-   *Password* (e.g., `userPassword`)
-   *Email Address* (e.g., `mail` or `email`)
-   *First Name* (e.g., `name` or `givenName`)
-   *Last Name* (e.g., `sn`)

**Note:** If you intend to create or import users with no email addresses, 
you must set `users.email.address.required=false` in `portal-ext.properties`.
With this set, Liferay auto-generates an email address combining the user ID
plus the suffix defined in the property `users.email.address.auto.suffix=`.
Finally, make sure to set Liferay and LDAP authentication to something other
than email address.

If you want to import LDAP groups as @product@ user groups, make sure define
a mapping for the @product@ group field so that membership information is
preserved:

  -   *Group* (e.g., *member*)

The other LDAP user mapping fields are optional.

The Control Panel provides default mappings for commonly used LDAP attributes.
You can also add your own mappings.

**Test LDAP Users:** Once you have your attribute mappings set up (see above),
click the *Test LDAP Users* button and @product@ attempts to pull LDAP users and
match them with their mappings as a preview.

![Figure 1: You should see a list of users when you click the *Test LDAP Users* button.](../../../images/testing-ldap-users.png)

### Groups

This section contains settings for mapping LDAP groups to @product@ user groups.

**Import Search Filter:** This is the filter for mapping LDAP groups to
@product@ user groups. For example, 

    (objectClass=groupOfNames)

Enter the LDAP group attributes you want retrieved for this mapping. The
following attributes can be mapped. The *Group Name* and *User* fields are
required, the *Description* is optional.

  - *Group Name* (e.g., `cn` or `o`)

  - *Description* (e.g., `description`)

  - *User* (e.g., `member`)

**Test LDAP Groups:** Click the *Test LDAP Groups* button to display a list of
the groups returned by your search filter.

### Export

This section contains settings for exporting user data from LDAP.

**Users DN:** Enter the location in your LDAP tree where the users are stored.
@product@ exports the users to this location.

**User Default Object Classes:** Users are exported with the listed default
object classes. To find out what your default object classes are, use an LDAP
browser tool such as Apache Directory Studio to locate a user and view the
Object Class attributes stored in LDAP for that user.

**Groups DN:** Enter the location in your LDAP tree where the groups are stored.
When @product@ does an export, it exports the groups to this location.

**Group Default Object Classes:** When a group is exported, the group is created
with the listed default object classes. To find out what your default object
classes are, use an LDAP browser tool such as [Apache Directory Studio](https://directory.apache.org/studio) to locate
a group and view the Object Class attributes stored in LDAP for that group.

When you've set all your options and tested your connection, click *Save*. 

| **Note:** If a user changes a value like a password in @product@, that change is
| passed to the LDAP server, provided @product@ has enough schema access to make
| the change.

Now you know how to connect an LDAP server to @product@ and how to
configure user import behavior, export behavior, and other LDAP settings.
