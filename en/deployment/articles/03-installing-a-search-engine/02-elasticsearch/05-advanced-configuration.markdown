# Advanced Configuration of the Liferay Elasticsearch Connector

[TOC levels=1-4]

The default configuration for Liferay's Elasticsearch connector module is set
in a Java class called `ElasticsearchConfiguration`.

While the Elasticsearch connector has a lot of configuration options out of the
box, you might find an Elasticsearch configuration you need that isn't provided
by default. In this case, add the configuration options you need. If something
is configurable for Elasticsearch, it's configurable using the Elasticsearch
connector.

## Adding Settings and Mappings to the Liferay Elasticsearch Connector

Think of the available configuration options as being divided into two groups:
the most common ones that are easily configured, and more complex
configurations requiring a more brute-force approach: these include the
`additionalConfigurations`, `additionalIndexConfigurations`,
`additionalTypeMappings`, and `overrideTypeMappings` settings. 

[Figure 1: You can add Elasticsearch configurations to the ones currently available in System Settings.](../../../images/cfg-elasticsearch-additional-configs.png)

### Additional Configurations

The `additionalConfigurations` configuration defines extra settings (in YAML)
for the embedded Elasticsearch. This is only useful for testing environments
using the embedded Elasticsearch server. Any node settings normally set in
`elasticsearch.yml` can be declared here. See the
[Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/index.html) 
for a description of all possible node settings.

### Adding Index Configurations

The `additionalIndexConfigurations` configuration defines extra settings (in
JSON or YAML) that are applied to the @product@ index when it's created. For
example, you can create custom analyzers and filters using this setting. For a
complete list of available settings, see the 
[Elasticsearch reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/index-modules.html).

Here's an example that shows how to configure 
[analysis](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/index-modules-analysis.html)
that can be applied to a field or a dynamic template (see
[below](#overriding-type-mappings) for an example application to a dynamic
template).

```json
{  
    "analysis": {
        "analyzer": {
            "kuromoji_liferay_custom": {
                "filter": [
                    "cjk_width",
                    "kuromoji_baseform",
                    "pos_filter"
                ],
                "tokenizer": "kuromoji_tokenizer"
            }
        },
        "filter": {
            "pos_filter": {
                "type": "kuromoji_part_of_speech"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Adding Type Mappings

`additionalTypeMappings` defines extra mappings for the `LiferayDocumentType`
type definition. These are applied when the index is created. Add the mappings
using JSON syntax. For more information see
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/mapping.html)
and
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/indices-put-mapping.html).
Use `additionalTypeMappings` for new field (`properties`) mappings and new
dynamic templates, but don't try to override existing mappings. If any of the
mappings set here overlap with existing mappings, index creation fails. Use
`overrideTypeMappings` to replace default mappings.

As with dynamic templates, you can add sub-field mappings to @product@'s type
mapping. These are referred to as
[properties](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/properties.html)
in Elasticsearch.

```json
{ 
    "LiferayDocumentType": {  
        "properties": {   
            "fooName": {
                "index": "true",
                "store": "true",
                "type": "keyword"
            }
        }   
    }
}
```

See
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/mapping-types.html)
for more details on Elasticsearch's field datatypes.

The above example shows how a `fooName` field might be added to @product@'s type
mapping. Because `fooName` is not an existing property in the mapping, it 
works fine. If you try to override an existing property mapping, index
creation fails. Instead use the `overrideTypeMappings` setting to override
`properties` in the mapping.

To see that your additional mappings have been added to the
`LiferayDocumentType`, use `curl` to access this URL after saving your
additions and re-indexing:

```bash
curl http://[HOST]:[ES_PORT]/liferay-[COMPANY_ID]/_mapping/LiferayDocumentType?pretty
```

Here's what it would look like for an Elasticsearch instance running on
`localhost:9200`, with a @product@ Company ID of `20116`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9200/liferay-20116/_mapping/LiferayDocumentType?pretty
```

In the above URL, `liferay-20116`is the index name. Including it indicates that
you want to see the mappings that were used to create the index with that name.

### Overriding Type Mappings

Use `overrideTypeMappings` to override @product@'s default type mappings. This
is an advanced feature that should be used only if strictly necessary. If you
set this value, the default mappings used to define the Liferay Document Type in
@product@ source code (for example, `liferay-type-mappings.json`) are ignored
entirely, so include the whole mappings definition in this property, not just
the segment you're modifying. To make a modification, find the entire list of
the current mappings being used to create the index by navigating to the URL

    http://[HOST]:[ES_PORT]/liferay-[COMPANY_ID]/_mapping/LiferayDocumentType?pretty

Copy the contents in as the value of this property (either into System Settings
or your OSGi configuration file). Leave the opening curly brace `{`, but delete
lines 2-4 entirely:

```json
"liferay-[COMPANY_ID]": {
    "mappings" : {
        "LiferayDocumentType" : {
```

Then, from the end of the mappings, delete the concluding three curly braces.

            }
        }
    }

Now modify whatever mappings you'd like. The changes take effect once you save
the changes and trigger a re-index from Server Administration. 

Here's a partial example, showing a 
[dynamic template](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/dynamic-templates.html)
that uses the analysis configuration from `additionalIndexConfigurations` to
analyze all string fields that end with `_ja`. You'd include this with all the
other default mappings, replacing the provided `template_ja` with this custom
one:

```json
{
    "LiferayDocumentType": {
        "dynamic_templates": [
            {
                "template_ja": {
                    "mapping": {
                        "analyzer": "kuromoji_liferay_custom",
                        "index": "analyzed",
                        "store": "true",
                        "term_vector": "with_positions_offsets",
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "match": "\\w+_ja\\b|\\w+_ja_[A-Z]{2}\\b",
                    "match_mapping_type": "string",
                    "match_pattern": "regex"
                }
                ...
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Multi-line YAML Configurations

If you configure the settings from the last section using an OSGi configuration
file, you might find yourself needing to write YAML snippets that span multiple
lines. The syntax for that is straightforward and just requires appending each
line with `\n\`, like this:

```yaml
additionalConfigurations=\
                    cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled: false\n\
                    cluster.service.slow_task_logging_threshold: 600s\n\
                    index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.warn: 600s\n\
                    index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.warn: 600s\n\
                    index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.warn: 600s\n\
                    monitor.jvm.gc.old.warn: 600s\n\
                    monitor.jvm.gc.young.warn: 600s
```

From simple configurations to overriding existing type mappings, Elasticsearch
and Liferay's connector to Elasticsearch are configurable.
