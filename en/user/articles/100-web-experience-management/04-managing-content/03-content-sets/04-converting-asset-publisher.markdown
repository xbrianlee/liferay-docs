# Converting Asset Publisher Configurations to Content Sets

[TOC levels=1-4]

In the previous two guides in this section, you've seen
[Creating Content Sets](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/creating-content-sets)
and
[Displaying Content Sets](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/displaying-content-sets) 
demonstrated. Next, try out converting an existing Asset Publisher
configuration to a Content Set.

In this case, you have an Asset Publisher on a page, which is configured to 
display images tagged as *trending* in reverse alphabetical order by title. 
This might not be too hard to reproduce in the *Content Set* creator, but it's 
even easier to create the Content Set definition directly from the Asset 
Publisher.

1.  Go to ![Options](../../../../images/icon-app-options.png) &rarr;
    *Configuration* for the Asset Publisher.

2.  Click *Create a content set from this configuration*.

    ![Figure 1: You can generate a Content Set directly from the Asset Publisher configuration.](../../../../images/content-set-create-ap.png)

3.  Enter the title and click *Save*.

And as quickly as that you have a new Content Set that you can use with Asset
Publishers anywhere on the site.

![Figure 2: The Content Set is added right alongside any existing sets.](../../../../images/content-set-ap-added.png)

Great! You converted your Asset Publisher configuration to a Content Set.
