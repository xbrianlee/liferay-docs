# Managing Content Sets

[TOC levels=1-4]

A Content Set is exactly what it sounds like: a set of content items. In short, 
an administrator can define a list of content, and then that list can be 
displayed. The way that the Content Set is displayed is determined by the 
method that is used to display it. For example, if the Content Set is being 
used by a smartwatch app, it could be displayed as a simple list of titles, and 
selecting a title would cause the full article to display on a connected mobile 
device. The same Content Set could be displayed in a web browser with the full 
content of each article.

| **Note:** In previous versions of @product@, you used the Asset Publisher to 
| define and display either static lists of assets or dynamic lists based on 
| criteria like tags, categories, or asset type. In @product-ver@ Content Sets 
| take the core idea of defining different types of asset lists and expand it. 
| Content Lists are created outside of the context of a specific application or 
| widget and can be used and re-used across different channels and applications.

## Creating and Displaying Content Sets

Content Sets are created through the Site Administration interface. All the 
features for creating and managing Content Sets are contained here. They are 
displayed using Liferay's widgets or your own custom applications. Read our
guides for information on
[Creating Content Sets](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/creating-content-sets)
and
[Displaying Content Sets](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/displaying-content-sets)

## Content Set Personalization

Content Sets can have variations driven by @product@'s Personalization engine. 
After you create a Content Set, if you have at least one User Segment created, 
you can create a personalized experience of the Content Set for that Segment.
To learn to harness the power of experience personalization for Content Sets, 
see
[Content Set Personalization](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/content-set-personalization).

## Converting Asset Publisher Configurations to Content Sets

You may have already gone through a great deal of work to create a perfect, 
curated list of content through the Asset Publisher, but now you want to 
display that list elsewhere without duplicating your work. You can do that with 
Content Sets. Read the
[Converting Asset Publisher Configuration to Content Sets guide](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/converting-asset-publisher)
article to learn more.
