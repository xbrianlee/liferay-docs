# Display Page Templates for Web Content

[TOC levels=1-4]

Display Page Templates provide a new level of control over the look and feel of
your content. The templates empower marketers and designers to create stunning
designs for Web Content. They use both Page Fragments and Web Content to provide
an easy way to create beautiful layouts for displaying articles.

One great way to use Display Pages Templates is to create standardized formats
for articles. If you examine the content on many writing platforms, each article
follows a similar format like this:

-  Header Image
-  Title
-  Main Body
-  Highlighted Quote
-  Footer with links to related articles or other content

Display Pages Templates let you create standard, reusable formats like this to 
streamline the creation of attractive content. Read on to learn more!
