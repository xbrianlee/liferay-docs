# Publishing Basic Web Content

[TOC levels=1-4]

Web Content is one of many different kinds of assets, along with blog posts,
wiki articles, message board posts, and other kinds of content. Like all of
these assets, @product@ handles Web Content using an asset framework that
includes categories, tags, comments, ratings and more. Please see
[Publishing Content Dynamically](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/publishing-content-dynamically)
for more information on Liferay's asset framework.

To start working with Web Content, publish some basic material using Web
Content Management's WYSIWYG editor. Then you can cover the editor's features
in greater depth and learn how to publish the content you create to a page.
