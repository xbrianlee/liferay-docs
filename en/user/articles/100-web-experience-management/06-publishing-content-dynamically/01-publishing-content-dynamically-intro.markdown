# Publishing Content Dynamically

[TOC levels=1-4]

Most content types are Assets. In the 
[Creating Web Content](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/creating-web-content) 
articles, you examined the most common type of asset: web content. Other types
of assets include blog posts, wiki articles, message board posts, bookmarks, and
documents. Developers can define custom asset types that use the asset
framework, which provides support for tags, categories, vocabularies, comments,
ratings, and asset relationships.

The Asset Publisher application displays assets. It has many configuration
options which you'll cover in this chapter. By default, Asset Publisher displays
abstracts (previews) of recently published assets with links to their full
views. You can configure the Asset Publisher app to display a table of assets,
a list of asset titles, or the full content of assets. You can also make it
display only certain kinds of assets, and you choose how many items to display
in a list. 

You might use Asset Publisher to display chosen content types, recent content,
or content by tags and categories. 

This section covers the following topics:

- Adding relationships between assets
- Publishing assets
- Publishing RSS feeds
- Restoring deleted assets

The first thing you'll learn about is tagging and categorizing content.
