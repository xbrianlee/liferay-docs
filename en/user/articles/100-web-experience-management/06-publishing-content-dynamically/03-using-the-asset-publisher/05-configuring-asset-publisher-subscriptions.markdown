[TOC levels=1-4]

The Asset Publisher application supports two kinds of subscriptions email

Enabling Email Subscription adds a *Subscribe* link to the Asset Publisher.
Users wishing to be notified of newly published assets can click on this link to
be added to the subscription list. @product@ periodically checks for new assets
and sends emails to subscribed users informing them about the new assets. By
default, Liferay performs this check every twenty-four hours.
