# Mobile Device Rules

[TOC levels=1-4]

With mobile device rules, you can alter what gets displayed based on the device
being used to access @product@. For instance, you can configure the look and
feel of pages accessed by mobile device users differently from those
accessed by users on a computer.

Whole Sites or individual pages can be configured for mobile device families.
A family describes a group of devices. You can set rules that describe
a category of devices, such as all Android devices or all iOS devices. You can
define as many rules in a family as you need to classify all the devices for
which you'd like to define actions. Families can be prioritized to determine
which one applies to a given page request.
