# Building Content Pages

[TOC levels=1-4]

To demonstrate Content Page capabilities, create a *Landing Page* for a space 
shuttle tour based on this design:

## Creating a Content Page

To create the page, follow these general steps:

1.  Add the Fragments you need to define the basic structure of the page.
2.  Edit the text for the current page.
3.  Edit the images.
4.  Publish the page.

You'll complete this process next.

1.  From Site Administration for your Site, go to *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages*.

2.  Click the (![Add](../../../../../images/icon-add.png)) and select *Content
    Page*.

3.  Set the *Name* as *Space Landing Page* and click *Save*.

    Now you're in Content Page creation. As you work, a draft of the page is
    automatically saved, but you must click *Publish* to make it available for
    use.

4.  Open *Sections* &rarr; *Basic Sections* and drag a *Banner Center* Fragment 
    onto the page.

5.  Open *Section Builder* &rarr; *Layouts* and add a 2 Column layout below
    that.
    
6.  Open *Basic Components*.

7.  Add a *Card* to the left column of the layout.

8.  Add a *Paragraph* to the right side, and then an *Image* below that inside 
    the same column.

Now that the structure is defined, start editing the text and images.

1.  Click in each text box and edit the text to be relevant to your goal of 
    directing potential customers to space shuttle tours.
    
    ![Figure 3: Edit the text and formatting as you see fit.](../../../../../images/content-page-creation-step-2.png)

2.  Click on the main banner image, and then on the 
    ![Edit](../../../../../images/icon-edit-pencil.png) icon.

3.  Select one of the many space flight images that are surely filling up your
    Documents and Media library, upload a new one, or specify a URL.

![Figure 4: Add some images, and the big picture comes together.](../../../../../images/content-page-creation-step-3.png)

Anytime during Fragment creation, you can remove, duplicate, or configure the
Fragment.

![Figure 5: Add some images, and the big picture comes together.](../../../../../images/content-page-fragment-options.png)

Configuring a Fragment lets you modify the default options for a provided
Fragment. This also lets you duplicate a Fragment and configure duplicates
differently, so you can reuse base Fragments instead of developing new ones.
When duplicating a Fragment, its configuration and editable elements are also
copied.

| **Note:** Fragment configuration and duplication are available in Liferay
| DXP 7.2 SP1+ and Liferay Portal GA2+.

This is looking good so far, but the one difference between the design mockup 
and the final result is that the background was black for the original. To 
finish it up, change the background color for the section to black.

1.  Click on the bottom Section and some additional icons will appear.

    ![Figure 6: You can change the background color, image, or edit spacing and padding for a section. You can also remove it.](../../../../../images/content-page-section-editor.png)

2.   Click on *Background Color* ![Background Color](../../../../../images/icon-color.png), and select Black.

3.  Finally, publish your page.

In just a few minutes, you used the power of Content Pages and Fragments to go 
from nothing to perfectly recreating a page design. To take it to the next 
level, head over to the
[Segmentation and Personalization guide](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/segmentation-and-personalization).
