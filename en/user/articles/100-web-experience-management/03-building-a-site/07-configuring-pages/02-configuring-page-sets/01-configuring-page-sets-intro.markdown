# Configuring Page Sets

[TOC levels=1-4]

To configure options for the entire Page Set, select the *Configure* icon next
to the Page Set in *Pages*. Options configured for the Page Set apply to all its
pages. Page Set options override options set at the Site level, and
customizations to an individual page override those for the Page Set.
