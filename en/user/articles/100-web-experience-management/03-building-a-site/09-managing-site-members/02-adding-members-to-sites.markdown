# Adding Members to Sites

[TOC levels=1-4]

In [Adding Sites](/docs/7-1/user/-/knowledge_base/u/adding-sites) you 
learned the difference between Site Membership Types and about public and 
private pages within a Site. Now you'll learn how to add users manually to Sites
and how to provide options for self management. For review, there are a few key
reasons why Site Membership management is important:

1.  Only Site Members can view a Site's Private Pages.

2.  Site Members have more permissions than guests for many widgets like Message
    Boards and Wikis that enable them to create content and collaborate on your
    Site.

3.  Site Members can be associated with Roles that grant Site privileges.

## Administrating Site Membership

Administrators can manage Site members from that Site's *Site Membership* page.

1.  Open *Site Administration* and select the Site that you want to manage
    members for.
 
2.  Click on *People* &rarr; *Memberships*

From here you can manage Site Memberships, Organization, and User Group
associations. You can learn more about those in the 
[Users and Organizations tutorial](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/users-and-organizations). Here
you see a list of all of the current Users of the Site and you can add or remove
user memberships from the Site.

### Adding Members to a Site

Follow these steps to make an existing user a member of the Site:

1.  Click the *New* (![Add User](../../../../images/icon-add.png)) 
    button in the top right of the screen.

2.  Use *Filter and Order* or the *Search* function to locate the User you want
    to add to the Site.
 
3.  Select the User(s) you wish and click *Done*.

On the *Assign Users to This Site* screen, all Users eligible to be added to the
Site appear. Deactivated Users do not appear. Site members also appear, but with
a greyed-out checkbox.

### Removing User Membership from a Site

There are two ways to remove a user from a Site. You can remove an individual 
member like this:

1.  Click the *Actions* (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) icon
    for the user that you want to remove.
 
2.  Select *Remove Membership*.

3.  In the pop-up that appears, confirm the removal.

![Figure 3: Selecting to remove a user. ](../../../../images/remove-user.png)

To remove several users at once, you can do this:

1.  Click the checkbox for each user that you want to remove.

2.  In the menu at the top of the page, click the `X` icon to remove the
    users from the Site. 

3.  In the pop-up that appears, confirm the removal.

Removed Users lose access to the Site's private pages and membership in any Site
Roles or Teams they had. 

### Assigning Site Roles

Roles grant permissions in @product@. Roles can be assigned for the entire
instance or just for one specific Site or Organization. Site Roles assign
permissions for a specific Site.

You can use the same interface options that you used to remove Users from the 
Site to assign them to Site Roles. If you select a User or Users and click
*Assign Site Roles* (either through the Actions menu or the menu at the top),
you are taken to the *Assign Site Roles* screen. From here:

1.  Select the Roles that you want to assign to the selected users.

2.  Click *Done*.

![Figure 4: Assigning Site Roles.](../../../../images/assigning-site-roles.png)

Site Roles are created at a global level, but when they're assigned they only
provide privileges for the specific Site where they were assigned. Since Roles
are created at a global level, they cannot be created by Site Administrators
(since Site Administrators only have Administrator privileges for their Site).
**Teams** allow Site Administrators to assign permissions to groups of Users
within their Sites. Next, you'll look at more configuration for managing members
of your Site.
