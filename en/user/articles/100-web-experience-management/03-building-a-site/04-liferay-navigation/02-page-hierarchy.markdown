# Page Hierarchy

[TOC levels=1-4]

Using the Page Hierarchy, you create public and private pages and organize
those pages in whatever order or structure that you see fit.

## Creating a Page

New pages are created on the *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages* page in Site 
Administration. Pages can be created as *Public Pages* which anyone can view, 
or *Private Pages* which can only be viewed by Site Members. To create a new 
page,

1.  Go to *Site Administration* for the Site you want to work on, then
    *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages*.

    ![Figure 1: In the default site, initially only the *Home* and the hidden *Search* pages exist in the Public Pages Hierarchy.](../../../../images/default-nav-pages.png)

2.  Click *Add* (![Add Page](../../../../images/icon-add.png)) and select
    *Public Page*.

3.  Select *Widget Page*.

4.  Set the *Name* as *About Us*.

5.  Click *Save*.

![Figure 2: When you create a page, by default it is added to the site hierarchy.](../../../../images/page-hierarchy-menu.png)

Now that the page is created, it appears in the hierarchy, and you can move or
organize its position there.

## Organizing Pages

Drag and drop pages to reorder their position in the page hierarchy (and
subsequently the default navigation that users see), and to nest them as
subpages. The page at the top of the list is the *Home* page that users see
automatically when visiting your Site. 

1.  Click *Go to Site* to view the organization of the navigation menu. You can
    see the order of the pages matches the order of the pages from Site
    Administration.

    ![Figure 3: You can see the order of pages in Site Administration vs. how they appear on the site.](../../../../images/navigation-practical1.png)

2.  Drag the *About Us* page above the *Welcome* page in the list. It
    automatically becomes the *Home* page.

3.  Click *Go to Site* to see how this affects your menu.

    ![Figure 4: *About Us* is now the home page, and *Welcome* is second in the nav.](../../../../images/navigation-practical2.png)

4.  Drag *About Us* on top of *Welcome* to nest it. 

5.  Click *Go to Site* one more time to see how nested pages appear.

![Figure 5: *About Us* is now nested under *Welcome* and appear when you mouse-over *Welcome*.](../../../../images/navigation-practical3.png)

As you've just demonstrated, organizing pages in the default menu is simple, 
but very powerful.

### Public and Private Pages

As noted above, Private Pages work just like Public Pages, except they can be
viewed only by registered members of a Site. In the default configuration,
Public Pages are at the URL `[web-address]/`**web**`/[site-name]` while Private
Pages are at `[web-address]/`**group**`/[site-name]`. Other than the membership
distinctions, Public and Private Pages share the same behavior.

## Page Options

While managing the default menu, you can also access page options. Clicking on
the *Options* icon [Option](../../../../images/icon-options.png) 
accesses several configuration tools:

**View** goes to the selected page on the Site.

**Configure** goes to page configuration.

**Copy Page** creates a new page in the current Site that duplicates the
selected page.

**Permissions** opens the Permissions dialog.

**Orphan Widgets** clears data related to widgets that have been removed from
the page.
 
**Delete** deletes the page and all its data.

Creating and managing pages using the page hierarchy is simple but very 
powerful. If you need more navigation options, however, Navigation
Menus provide more flexibility.
