# Managing Site Navigation

[TOC levels=1-4]

Liferay provides powerful tools for creating and organizing pages. You can have
anything from a simple, flat Site navigation to a complex hierarchy with tree of
sub-pages nested down many levels.

@product-ver@ lets you create Navigation Menus separate from your page
hierarchy. Now you have the freedom to leave one-off marketing landing pages out
of the navigation or create multiple navigation menus: a main menu, secondary
menus, footer menus, and custom menus for anything that you can dream up.

Menus can differ by page: landing pages can show a simple list of frequently
visited pages, and the rest can appear in secondary navigation. You can also
create specific menus for different landing pages to direct users to content
that is relevant to them.

Go to *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages* to view the existing pages or create new
pages. The Site hierarchy as displayed on *Pages* is the main reference for the
organization of pages on that Site. While Navigation Menus can customize their
organization and what appears and what doesn't appear, this menu is always the
primary reference for the pages on your Site.
