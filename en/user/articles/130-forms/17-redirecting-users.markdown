# Redirecting Users

[TOC levels=1-4]

When users submit a form, you can present them with another page indicating 
success or some other information related to their submission. Sometimes all you 
need is a 
[success page](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/form-success-pages), 
but other times you might want to send users to a specific URL. 

Whatever your use case is, follow these steps to set up a redirect URL: 

1.  Open the form's *Form Settings* section by clicking the *Options* button 
    (![Options](../../images/icon-options.png)) 
    and select *Settings*. 

2.  Enter the redirect URL in the *Redirect URL* field. 

That's it! Now when users submit the form, they're not left wondering what to do 
next.
