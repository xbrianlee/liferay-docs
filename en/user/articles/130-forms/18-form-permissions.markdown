# Form Permissions

[TOC levels=1-4]

To access a form's permissions, first navigate to the Forms app in *Site
Administration* (your site's menu) &rarr; *Content & Data* &rarr; *Forms*. Then
click the form's *Actions* button (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)),
and select *Permissions*. 

By default, you can grant these permissions for a form: 

**Delete:** Delete the form. 

**Permissions:** Access and configure the form's permissions. 

**Update:** Update form entries. 

**Add Form Instance Record:** Submit form entries. 

**View:** View the form.

Note that guest users can view and fill out forms by default. The *Guest* Role 
has *View* and *Add Form Instance Record* permissions. 

| **Note:** By default, all users inherit the Guest Role's permissions. The Guest
| Role represents unauthenticated visitors of your Site. If you want to let
| Guest users submit forms (the default setting), it makes sense that
| authenticated users can also. To disable automatic inheritance of the Guest
| Role's permissions, set
| [this property](@platform-ref@/7.2-latest/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html#Permissions)
| in your `portal-ext.properties` file:
| 
|     `permissions.check.guest.enabled=false`
