# Form Pages

[TOC levels=1-4]

Are users more likely to abandon long forms with lots of scrolling? Are they 
more likely to see a multi-page form and abandon it without a second look, 
assuming that it gets longer and more tedious with every passing page? Such 
usability questions are worth thinking about. If you decide multiple pages are 
appropriate for your form, Liferay Forms supports two pagination styles: 
default, and alternate.

To add a form page, 

1.  Go to a form's builder view. 

2.  Click the *Actions* button (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)) at
    the top-right corner of the form, then click *Add New Page*.

You can also delete form pages, add 
[success pages](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/form-success-pages), 
and switch pagination modes.
