# Duplicating Forms and Form Fields

[TOC levels=1-4]

Repetitive tasks are error prone. Instead of duplicating effort, duplicate
forms and form fields. 

To duplicate a form, 

1.  Go to *Site Administration* (your Site's menu) &rarr; *Content & Data*
    &rarr; *Forms*. 

2.  Click the *Actions* button 
    (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)) 
    for the form to duplicate. 

3.  Click *Duplicate*.

![Figure 1: The Duplicate option works the same for forms and form fields.](../../images/forms-duplicate-form.png)

The form is duplicated and automatically named *Copy of [Original Form Name]*. 
Once duplicated, you can edit the form however you want. When you duplicate a 
form, all configurations and form rules are duplicated as well. 

To duplicate a form field, 

1.  Go to *Site Administration* (your Site's menu) &rarr; *Content & Data*
    &rarr; *Forms* and open or add a form. 

2.  In the Builder view, hover over the form field to duplicate and click the
    *Copy* icon 
    (![Copy](../../images/icon-copy.png)). 

![Figure 2: You can duplicate form fields.](../../images/forms-duplicate-form-field.png)

The field is duplicated and labeled *Copy of [Original Field Label]*. All the 
form's properties, including its data provider configurations, are copied as
well.
