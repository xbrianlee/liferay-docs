# Autocompleting Text Fields

[TOC levels=1-4]

It's been scientifically proven that Internet users are lazy (not you, of
course---other Internet users). For example, some users may not fill out your
form if you make them type the entire title of their country in an employment
application. This is especially true if they're filling out the form on their
mobile devices. Make users' lives easier by configuring autocomplete on a
form's text fields. 

Why not just use a select field with a data provider to guide user input?
Sometimes a data provider can't encompass all possible field entries. For
example, if your data provider doesn't include [mythical countries founded on
old sea platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Sealand),
users the Principality of Sealand can't enter anything into the select field.
Instead use a text field with autocomplete so users can begin typing their
country's name and then select it from a list when it appears. Autocomplete
combines a text field (accepting any response that meets your validation
criteria) and common choices to select from. It's a win-win situation. 

## Configuring Autocomplete

Before configuring autocomplete for your text fields, 
[create a form and add a text field](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/creating-and-managing-forms). 
If you want the autocomplete options to be populated by a REST data provider,
[configure one](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/data-providers) 
before creating your form. Now you're ready to configure autocomplete for the
field: 

1.  In the field configuration sidebar, click the *Properties* tab.

2.  Click the *Autocomplete* switcher so it's enabled.

3.  Select a data provider or create one manually. You can set up a data 
    provider from a 
    [REST service](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/data-providers), 
    or manually enter the options users should see when they start typing in the 
    text field. 

4.  Save and Publish the form.

Once users begin entering text into the field, a selection list of options 
appears. As they enter additional text, the list is refined to include only 
options that contain the currently entered text. For example, the imaginary 
users from Sealand (all two of them) begin reluctantly typing their country of
origin by entering an *S*. They're delighted to see a selection list with a
bunch of countries containing the letter *S* appear for their selection
convenience. If they continue typing and enter *e*, the list is refined to 
options that have *se* in their name (for example Serbia and Senegal). If they 
continue typing and enter *a*, they'll now only see one option, Sealand, if it's 
in your data provider. Selecting it from the list after typing the first three 
letters is much easier than typing the remaining letters.

What will the Forms team think of next? Configuring telepathic connections to 
the Forms application would be nice. Then users could just think their form
field entries into existence. Stay tuned.
