# Action: Autofill

[TOC levels=1-4]

Autofill rules let you change the selection options of another field based on
the value entered into a related field. A 
[data provider's](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/data-providers) 
output is used to populate a field, as long as the condition is met.

Before configuring an autofill rule, 
[set up a data provider](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/data-providers). 
That's how autofilled fields are populated. Pay careful attention to the
input and output parameters you choose when setting up the rule.

To follow this example: 

1.  Set up a data provider using the `get-countries` JSON web service. If you're
    running @product@ at `localhost:8080`, you can access this web service here:
        
        http://localhost:8080/api/jsonws?contextName=&signature=%2Fcountry%2Fget-countries-0

    Make sure the output parameter is set to `$..nameCurentValue`. If you're unsure
    how to do this, first read the article on 
    [Data Providers](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/data-providers).

2.  On the last form page, add two fields:

    - A Single Selection field called *If I win I'd like my award to be:*, with
      two choices: *Cash* and  *All Expenses Paid Vacation*.

    - A Select from List field called *Choose a Destination Country*. Under
      *Create List*, choose *From Autofill*.

| **Example:** Before submitting the race registration, let users decide whether
| they want a cash prize or an all-expenses-paid vacation. If they choose the
| vacation, populate the Choose a Destination Country with output from the data
| provider.
| 
| To configure an Autofill rule,
| 
| 1. Open the Rules tab of the Edit Form page and click the Add
|    (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)) button.
| 
| 2. Define the rule:
|     - If field *If I win I'd like my award to be* is equal to
|         the Value *All Expenses Paid Vacation*, Autofill the *Choose a Destination
|         Country* field from the *countries* data provider (note that you might
|         have named this differently when setting it up).
| 
|     ![Figure 1: Build form rules quickly by defining your conditions and actions.](../../../images/forms-autofill.png)
| 
|     - Save the rule.

## Using Inputs with Autofill

The above example is simple, using only an Output to autofill a Select from List
field if another field has a certain value. Many times, the response from the
REST provider must be filtered before display in the Select from List field. For
this, a Data Provider Input field is required. For example, to configure an
autofill rule to display the countries of the world filtered by a Region field
(for example, Americas, Europe, or Oceania),

1.  Create a Data Provider.

    **Name:** `restcountries`

    **URL:** `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/region/{region}?fields=name`

    **Inputs:** Fill in the Label (*region*), Parameter (*region*), and Type
    (*Text*).

    **Outputs:** fill out a  Label (*name*), Path (*$..name*), and Type
    (*List*).

    To understand more about these values, read the 
    [Data Provider documentation](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/data-providers).

    ![Figure 3: Create a data provider for the autofill rule.](../../../images/forms-autofill-data-provider.png)

2.  Create a form with these fields:

    **Text:** Use the Label *Region*.

    **Select from List:** Label it *Country*, and choose *From Autofill* under
    Create List.

    ![Figure 4: Create a form with a text field and a select from list field. These are used to provide the input to the data provider and be autofilled by its output.](../../../images/forms-autofill-input-output-fields.png)

3.  Configure the Autofill rule.

    **Condition:** If *Region* **Is not Empty**

    **Action:** Do **Autofill** From Data Provider `restcountries`, Data
    Provider's Input: region---*Region*, Data Provider's Output:
    name---*Country*.

    ![Figure 5: Create the autofill rule. Brag of your prowess.](../../../images/forms-autofill-rule.png)

Once you're done, publish the form and try it out, by entering a valid region
into the Region field, and observing that the options in the Select from List
Field are filtered based on the Region. The
[restcountries.eu](https://restcountries.eu) service has
these regions you can use: Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and Polar.

Autofill rules combine the power of data providers and form rules.
