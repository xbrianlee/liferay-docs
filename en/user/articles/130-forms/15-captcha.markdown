# Enabling CAPTCHA on Form Submissions

[TOC levels=1-4]

[CAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) 
prevents a bot from submitting forms. It's often used in 
[login apps](/docs/7-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/logging-into-liferay), 
but you can also use it in the Forms app. 

To enable CAPTCHA, click the form's *Options* button 
(![Options](../../images/icon-options.png)) 
and select *Settings*. Enable the *Require CAPTCHA* setting, click *Done*, and 
save the form. That's all there is to it!
