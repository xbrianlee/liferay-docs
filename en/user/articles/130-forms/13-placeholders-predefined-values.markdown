# Help Text, Placeholder Text, and Predefined Values

[TOC levels=1-4]

Form fields can have help text, placeholder text, and predefined values.

-   **Help Text:** Text that appears as a sub-heading to the field label, but 
    doesn't appear in the field entry area. Enter help text in the Basic tab of 
    the field's sidebar menu.

-   **Placeholder Text:** Text in the field entry area that isn't submitted if 
    the field is left untouched by the user. 

-   **Predefined Value:** Text in the field entry area that is submitted if the 
    field is left untouched by the user. 

All form field types can have help text, and all form field types that accept 
user input can have predefined values. Only text and numeric fields can have 
placeholder text. 

To enter placeholder text or predefined values, 

1.  Open a field's sidebar menu.

2.  Open the *Properties* tab.

For example, many forms start with a *Full Name* field. You can use help text
and/or placeholder text to inform users that you need their full names,
regardless of length. Alternatively, if you're asking users to specify how many
sandwiches they eat for lunch, a predefined value of *1* probably makes sense.

Remember, placeholder values aren't submitted if the field is left blank, so you 
don't have to worry about getting a bunch of submissions from
