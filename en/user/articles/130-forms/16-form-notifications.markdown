# Form Notifications

[TOC levels=1-4]

You can configure the Forms app to send a notification email each time a form 
entry is submitted.

1.  Open the form's *Form Settings* section by clicking the *Options* button 
    (![Options](../../images/icon-options.png)) 
    and selecting *Settings*. 

2.  Click the *Email Notifications* tab, enable the option 
    *Send an Email Notification for Each Entry*, and fill out these fields: 

    **From Name:** The sender's name. This could be the Site name, the form 
    name, or anything else informative to the recipient.

    **From Address:** The sender's email address. You can use something like 
    `noreply@example.com`, so that recipients don't try to reply. 

    **To Address:** The recipient's email address (e.g., `test@example.com`).

    **Subject:** The email's subject. An informative subject line tells the
    recipient what happened. For example, An application for employment was
    submitted in The Lunar Resort*. 

Note that if you [enabled workflow for the
form](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/sending-form-entries-through-a-workflow)
and it already sends a notification, you might not need to configure the Forms
app to generate a notification.
