# Translating Forms

[TOC levels=1-4]

Forms can be translated to any locale that @product@ supports. The form builder 
specifies a translation of the form's default language. 

The form's default language and the available translations are set in the
[site's language configuration](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/social-settings-and-languages#languages).

Follow these steps to create a form translation: 

1.  Go to *Site Administration* (your site's menu) &rarr; *Content & Data* &rarr; 
    *Forms* and open the form to translate. 

2.  Click the + icon next to the current translation language and choose from
    the available languages.

3.  Translate the form's title, field labels, field options, field placeholder
    text, and any other text visible to the user.

4.  Save and publish the form.

To fill out a translated form in a translated language, 

1.  Access the form. If a signed-in user accesses the form and a translation is 
    available in the user's language, the user sees the translated form by 
    default.

2.  To see the form in a different language, click the language icon and select
    a language. 

3.  Fill out the form as usual and click *Submit*. 

| **Note:** Translations work differently depending on how a User accesses a Form:
| 
| If [accessed in the Form widget on a @product@
| page](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/creating-and-managing-forms#accessing-forms),
| the Form is displayed in the User's language automatically. If there's no
| translation available for the User's language, the default language of the Form
| is displayed.  
|
| If accessed via direct
| [URL](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/creating-and-managing-forms#accessing-forms),
| the Form translation must be selected manually.
