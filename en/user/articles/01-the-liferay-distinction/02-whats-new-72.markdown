## Key New Features

Ensure your business evolves and stays relevant with new features
designed to support great customer experiences across all stages of the
customer journey. 

### Experience Creation

Great digital experiences are imperative in today's competition for new
business. Companies also need to make sure they stay relevant after the
sale, investing in long-term customer relationships that cultivate
loyalty and repeat business. Here are some new features to help you
ensure you're creating and delivering excellent experiences all the
time.

#### Content Authoring

@product-ver@ evolves our content authoring and management
capabilities significantly, making it even easier and more intuitive for
the non-technical content creator to create and manage engaging content.

#### Site Building

Content pages now allow users to create experiences that have both
applications and content on the same page, giving businesses increased
flexibility to create experiences tailored to fit the needs of different
end users. More tools have been provided to allow for richer layouts and
functionality for the non-technical user to build a visually
appealing site experience easily. 

#### Fragments

This release expands on the functionality available to create fragments,
which previously required developer involvement. For marketers looking
to create a fragment for their use case, we provide new functionality that
allows a non-technical user to create simple fragments easily through the page
editor itself by dragging and dropping out-of-the-box components into
a container. 

![Figure 2: Fragments make it easy to build pages.](../../images/fragments-pages.png)

#### Fragments Toolkit/CLI

Improvements to the web developer's experience has also been made for
@product-ver@. A set of front-end toolkits---including a CLI tool---is provided
so web developers can write fragments in their own code editors and
import/export them without needing to redeploy.

#### In-Context Editing and Content Previews

An improved site building interface shows users how different content would
appear to different visitors. @product@ allows content creators to preview
content in context of how it would look like on a live site. 

#### Content Usages

For structured content that can be mapped and delivered across multiple
locations, a new feature has been introduced to allow the content creator to
view where specific pieces of web content are being used and reused across their
channels.

#### A/B Testing (DXP only)

Content creators can use A/B testing to create and customize tests to evaluate
which elements on Content Pages perform better and edit content accordingly.
Liferay DXP's A/B tests leverage Bayesian statistics to identify the probable
values of lift for a variant, allowing your business to make more informed
decisions. Native integration with Liferay Analytics Cloud allows for data
collected for the running test to determine a winning variant. 

### Personalization

In @product-ver@, segmentation and personalization capabilities have
been moved into the core product. This allows for a more seamless
integration of content creation and personalization functionality and
helps streamline the process of creating segments while creating
personalized experiences.

#### Session Rules

There are many different pieces of information available to track a web
visitor. Session rules help further identify their distinct digital
fingerprint per visit and is something that marketers can leverage to
identify who is a repeat visitor and who is a new visitor.

#### Rule Builder

Being able to sort intelligently through vast amounts of data and
associated individuals can be tedious; this process should be easy and
not have to be curated manually. Marketers should instead be able to
build lists of individuals based on a specific set of criteria using
rules, leading to time savings and efficiency. The rule builder helps
enable more effective targeting by reducing the amount of manual work
needed to create a specific list of people who fall under certain pieces
of criteria.

![Figure 4: The Rule Builder provides a drag-and-drop interface that helps you build exactly the criteria you need to target the right information to the right users.](../../images/rule-builder.png)

#### Content Sets

Content sets help address the use case of personalizing a feed of content for
different groups of people. Users can easily target and personalize multiple
pieces of content in a fragment or widget and have it display accordingly for
the visitor.

#### Experiences

The new Experiences feature allows a user to create different variations
of a page. All the tools available for creating a page in the layout editor are
also available for making these page variations. Non-technical users can easily
tailor the messaging, images and even widgets on a page.

#### Content Recommendations (DXP only)

Content recommendations leverages interest models generated in Liferay Analytics
Cloud to recommend content on Liferay DXP. The option to do so is available
through Content Sets and automatically filters content based on interest
keywords. Liferay Analytics Cloud uses AI to cluster topics and model long-term
interest for known and unknown visitors. Keywords are taken from the categories,
tags, and keywords of content. 

### Bulk Management

Enterprises regularly manage large volumes of content and work that gets
generated on their digital properties. The need to manage and accurately
categorize these assets can be overwhelming, if not impossible, to maintain and
use. Bulk management features provided in @product-ver@ help reduce the amount
of manual labor through automation and tools that perform bulk actions.

#### Auto-Tagging

Users can automatically assign the correct metadata for images,
documents and web content. Having rich metadata assigned to the proper
content helps to not only reduce the amount of manual, tedious work, but
also improves the searchability of assets. The resulting metadata that
accumulates helps establish the foundation needed for content
personalization efforts and content automation. An Auto-Tagging API lets
developers extend the functionality to tag any asset with any selected
auto-tagging service.

#### Bulk Operations

Improvements have been made to make the experience of managing tags,
categories, and file operations much easier at scale. 

#### Automatic Document Versioning Policies

Refinements to how documents can be versioned are provided in 7.2. The
functionality for document versioning has been expanded to let users define
their own versioning policies and apply them to @product@. This is in addition
to the existing default versioning system @product@ provides out-of-the-box.

### Business Operations

Digital enterprises today must possess efficient back office organization to
support the delivery of great customer experiences. It is crucial to fulfill
these customer interactions and ensure those experiences are delivered and
supported in a timely manner. Achieving this kind of efficiency, for a great
customer experience, requires involvement from different departments and
stakeholders and affects a lot of disparate content and processes. @product-ver@
helps enterprises navigate these problems with features to help support
streamlining and optimizing those processes and operations.

#### Forms API

Reduce the time it takes for IT to deliver custom applications for the
business. Automate data collection through applications.

#### Workflow Metrics

Workflow metrics helps users gain insight into how long certain workflow events
take to complete. Users can set deadlines on a workflow process's events; these
configurations are called Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Once defined, use
Workflow Reports to measure compliance with the SLAs. The analytics and metrics
generated can help you understand the throughput performance of your processes
in a given timeframe, allowing users to better optimize their processes. 

#### Workflow Reports

Cut down the time it takes to serve your customers. New reports for workflow
processes help users identify operational bottlenecks and work efficiently to
increase revenue goals.

#### Online Document Editing

Integration with Office 365 and Google Docs allows the creation and editing of
documents stored in @product@. Users can manage documents, presentations, and
spreadsheets with the power that the suite provides and store them in
@product@'s document repository for future access. This feature takes advantage
of the existing permissions system, versioning, and sharing capabilities already
included with @product-ver@. 

#### P2P Asset Sharing

In addition to being able to create and edit documents easily, users can
now comment and share documents with other registered users. This allows for
faster coordination without the need of assigning custom permissions.

![Figure 5: You can share assets with other users easily.](../../images/share-assets.png)

#### Improved Identity Management Tools

New improvements have also been made to help tackle tedious tasks of
handling personal data erasure requests. Logical hierarchies for assets
are now in place to help simplify bulk deletion and anonymization during
the review process. Filtering and scoping capabilities across @product@ help
provide greater context when reviewing personal data, and administrators can be
informed when specific applications will delete or anonymize data during the
auto-anonymization process. All of these improvements help ensure compliance
with GDPR and other data protection laws.

### Headless Capabilities

Give your developers the freedom to create any presentation layer and
content creators the ease of traditional content management tools.
@product-ver@ provides a decoupled architecture to allow for a range
of approaches towards content management and delivery. Enterprises can choose
a traditional CMS or experience management approach, a full headless approach or
a hybrid approach.

#### OpenAPI

Liferay's API layer supports the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/resources/open-api/) specification, the most popular
open source framework for REST APIs. This allows for greater
flexibility, security and ease of integration as the OpenAPI
specification is language-agnostic, allows for security audits, and
clients can understand and consume services without knowledge of server
implementation or access to the server code.

#### Headless CMS

Enable developers to manage web content headlessly. Headless capabilities in
this version are also provided to help enable omnichannel experiences from
a single source of data. Content delivery APIs allow for developers to deliver
richer, faster and more responsive user experiences, no matter the device.
Front-end developers can leverage their native tools and frameworks they're
already familiar with to build sites. These APIs provide access to a variety of
assets and content in @product@.

Content participation APIs are also provided to support user interactions with
comments and ratings for web content and assets.

### Developer Experience

In addition to the new headless capabilities that are provided on
@product-ver@, improvements to developer tools and the developer
experience has been made. These tools help developers accelerate time to
market and tailor the platform for your business needs. 

#### Upgrade Tool

A revamped Upgrade Tool simplifies the upgrade process from previous versions of
@product@. This all-in-one tool allows system administrators to reduce the
time spent troubleshooting by helping them plan their upgrade process for
database migrations, checking properties, and restarting failed upgrades. 

#### Front-end Toolkits

Front-end toolkits allow developers to create an application using their
favorite JavaScript framework. The toolkit resolves any conflicting JavaScript
packages and bundles the application properly to deploy it into @product@
seamlessly.

#### Struts Removed

Though @product@ never used a version of Struts with security vulnerabilities,
the Struts library has been removed, and it is no longer a part of the product.
