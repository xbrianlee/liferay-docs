# The Liferay Distinction

[TOC levels=1-4]

Your web presence is a big deal, and the software platform that runs it must be
up to the task. You must be able to update your site easily, to provide your
partners with the services they need, and to enable your users and customers to
interact with you. It shouldn't be complicated: in today's cloud-based
environment, you should be able to make changes with a click of a button and
dynamically allocate nodes whenever you need them. 

@product@ offers all of this and more. It is a mature, stable, open source
platform with a strong heritage of serving some of the biggest sites in the
world---and some of the smallest, too. 

The documentation here shows you how to use it. This is the
**User** section,
which describes the features of an installed @product@, how to configure its
applications, and how to build your website. 

The **Developer** section is divided into five subsections: 

[**Application Development**](/docs/7-2/appdev/-/knowledge_base/a/application-development) shows you how you can build applications using
industry standard tools and frameworks on @product@. 

[**Tutorials**](/docs/7-2/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/developer-tutorials) lead you step-by-step through specific tasks, such as developing
web applications, upgrading old applications, creating themes, and more. 

[**Frameworks**](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/frameworks) show you all the Liferay APIs and development frameworks you can
use in your applications to streamline development. 

[**Customization**](/docs/7-2/customization/-/knowledge_base/c/liferay-customization) explains the myriad of ways @product@ can be customized to
your exact specifications. 

[**Reference**](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/developer-reference) is a collection of material showing developers the options
available for various APIs. 

The [**Installation and Upgrades**](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/installation-and-upgrades.html) section shows administrators how to obtain, install, and
configure @product@ on bare metal, virtualized environments, and the cloud. 

If you're coming from an older version, read on to learn what's new in
@product-ver@.
