# Using the Calendar Widget

[TOC levels=1-4]

The calendar widget displays a small monthly calendar showing an overview of
upcoming events. A larger area shows the Scheduler, a more detailed calendar
with a number of options: you can set it to to display a *Day*, *Week*, or
*Month*, or choose a more event-oriented *Agenda* setting.

![Figure 1: The default view is set in configuration, but a user can change it at any time.](../../images/calendar-view.png)

Two calendars are included by default when the widget is first added to a page:
a personal calendar for the current user and a Site calendar for the current
Site. These are displayed in the widget's lower left. Next to each calendar is
a colored box: click it to show/hide that calendar's events in the main viewing
area.

## Adding New Calendars

To create a new personal calendar,

1.  Click on the arrow to the right of the *My Calendars* header and select
    *Add Calendar* from the menu. 

2.  Fill in the *Add Calendar* form. Give the calendar a name and description,
    set a time zone, and decide if it's your user's *default calendar*---the one
    that is shown automatically whenever the widget is displayed. You can also
    pick a color, which color codes events whenever multiple calendar's events
    are displayed at once. You can also decide to enable ratings or comments on
    the calendar's events, and configure permissions.

To edit an existing calendar instead of adding a new one, select *Manage
Calendars* from the menu.

To add or edit a Site calendar, open the menu next to the header with the
Site's name.

## Adding Events to a Calendar

To add events to a calendar, 

1.  Click on any day in the main viewing area to open an event creation pop up.
    If you've selected the *Day* or *Week* view, you can click on the specific
    time when your event begins.

    ![Figure 3: When you click anywhere on the calendar, you'll see the event creation pop up appear. Click *Edit* to specify details for your event.](../../images/new-calendar-event-popup.png)

2.  Name your event and assign it to a calendar. Click *Save* to
    create the event immediately or *Edit* to enter additional information.

    ![Figure 4: You can specify event details such as the event title, start date, end date, description, location, and more.](../../images/new-calendar-event-details.png)

3.  If you clicked *Edit*, complete the *Edit Event* form. Enter start and end
    times and enter a description. To schedule an event that reoccurs,
    check the *Repeat* box and fill in the *Repeat* pop up.

    ![Figure 5: The *Repeat* box allows you to specify whether an events repeats daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly, how often it repeats, and when (or if) it ends.](../../images/new-calendar-event-repeat.png)

### Additional Event Functions

At the bottom of the *Edit Event* form, there are several collapsed sections:
*Details*, *Invitations*, *Reminders*, *Categorization*, and *Related
Assets*.

#### Details

In the Details section, you can move the event to another calendar and enter
a location.

#### Invitations

In the invitations section, invite Users, Sites, or Calendar Resources (see the
next tutorial for more on resources: in brief, a resource is anything you might
need for an event---a conference room, a vehicle, etc.). Follow these steps:

1.  Enter the name of an invitee (User, Site, or Resource) in the
    *Invitations* field. Hit *Enter* to add them to the *Pending* column.

2.  Check the availability of invitees by clicking the arrow next to the their
    names and selecting *Check Availability*. This displays their calendars
    (assuming you have permission to view them).

An automated email is sent to invitees who must navigate to the calendar
widget to respond. See below to customize the content of the invitation.

When invitees respond to the invitation, their names move to the *Accepted*,
*Declined*, or *Maybe* columns.

#### Reminders

Schedule up to two email reminders to send to attendees. Reminders translate
the time of the event into the recipients own time zone.

See below to customize the content of the reminder email.

#### Categorization

Tag your event or assign it to a category so it appears in appropriate search
results and is published by any asset publisher set to publish content assigned
to the same category.

#### Related Assets

List an asset---such as an agenda or supplementary material for a meeting---as
related to your event. Links to related assets are displayed in the *Event
Details* window.

#### Saving and Drafting Changes and Updating Permissions

At the very bottom of the Edit form is a set of buttons that let you publish the 
changes, save the changes as a draft, and configure the event's permissions. 

Giving a user permission to add, delete, or update discussion allows them to
make, edit and remove comments on the event. The *Permissions* permission
allows a Role to update permissions for the event.

## Customizing Email Notifications

To customize email notifications for event invitations and reminders,

1.  From the Calendar widget, click on the arrow next to a calendar and select
    *Calendar Settings*.

    ![Figure 6: Email templates apply to a single calendar and all its events.](../../images/calendar-email-note.png)

2.  Click on the *Notification Templates* tab. Then select either the *Invite
    Email* or the *Reminder Email* sub-tab.

3.  Edit the email as desired. At the bottom of the screen is a glossary that
    specifies variables for terms that were set when you created the event. Use
    these variables to refer to event-specific information, such as the
    event's name, date or location. It's a good idea to include a link to the
    event (use the variable `[$EVENT_URL$]`) as users must navigate to
    the calendar widget in order to respond.

Click *Save*. Now your notifications contain the proper text.

installation to another.
