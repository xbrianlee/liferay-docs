# Users Instance Settings

[TOC levels=1-4]

The Users configuration defines the look and feel of the Personal Menu, the 
default user associations for Users, and defines whether specific fields are 
available when a new User creates an account. 

To access the Users settings, Open the Control Panel and navigate to 
*Configuration* &rarr; *Instance Settings*, and select the *Users* category 
under the *PLATFORM* section. 

The Users Instance configuration contains three entries:

- Personal Menu
- Default User Associations
- Fields

Each configuration entry is described in the corresponding section below. 

## Personal Menu

The Personal Menu configuration entry specifies whether personal applications
use the same look and feel as the current site or if they should use the look
and feel of the My Dashboard pages instead. You can also specify whether the
personal menu appears in the Control Menu (as it did in past versions of
@product@) by toggling the *Show in Control Menu* option on and off. 

## Default User Associations

The Default User Associations configuration entry defines the default Sites,
Organization Sites, Roles, and User Groups you want all new Users assigned to
automatically. By default, new Users are only assigned to the Users Role. User
groups are handy tools for pre-populating your Users' private Sites with pages,
assigning Roles and permissions, and managing site membership. If you update
this configuration after your Users have created their accounts, don't worry.
You can apply the updates to existing Users by checking the *Apply to Existing
Users* checkbox. Changes take effect the next time the User signs in. 

## Fields

The Fields configuration entry contains settings for enabling/disabling the 
fields listed below on the Add/Edit User Form:

- Autogeneration of screen names
- Birthday field
- Gender field
