# More Platform Section Instance Settings

[TOC levels=1-4]

The Instance Settings also contain settings for Infrastructure and Localization, 
as well as integrations for Analytics and Third Party map APIs. Each 
configuration entry is described in the corresponding section below. 

## Infrastructure

The Infrastructure category contains settings to specify which content types are 
validated during the Import/Export process and whether to delete temporary LAR 
files during the Import/Export process. 

To access these settings, open the Control Panel and navigate to *Configuration* 
&rarr; *Instance Settings* and select *Infrastructure* under the PLATFORM 
heading. 

## Localization

The Localization category contains the configuration for setting the default 
instance language and time zone for the virtual instance. You can also configure 
the Language Selector's look and feel from the Widget Scope.

*Configuration* &rarr; *Instance Settings*, and select the *Localization* 
category under the *PLATFORM* section.

## Analytics
