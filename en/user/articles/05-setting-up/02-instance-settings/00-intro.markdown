# Setting Up a Virtual Instance

[TOC levels=1-4]

Once @product@ is installed, the configuration begins. Recall that 
configuration happens at different scopes. Here we're covering configuration at 
the virtual instance scope. There's an important difference between the system 
scope and the instance scope. The system scope is the highest level scope you 
can make configurations at. All virtual instances are impacted by configuration 
done at this scope. The instance scope applies only to one particular virtual 
instance.

Virtual instances have unique domain names but share a server and database. Each 
virtual instance can have independent data and configurations.
