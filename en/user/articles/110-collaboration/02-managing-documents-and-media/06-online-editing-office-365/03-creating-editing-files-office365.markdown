# Creating and Editing Documents and Media Files with Office 365â„¢

[TOC levels=1-4]

You can use Office 365&trade; to create and edit text documents, spreadsheets, 
or presentations for storage in the Documents and Media library. When you finish 
your Office 365&trade; editing session, you must check in the document to save 
the changes in the Documents and Media Library. 

Here, you'll learn how to do these things:

-   [Authenticate with OneDrive&trade;](#authentication)
-   [Create Files](#creating-files)
-   [Edit Files](#editing-files)

## Authentication

The first time you create or edit a Documents and Media file via Office 
365&trade;, you must authenticate with your Microsoft account. This links 
OneDrive&trade; to your @product@ account, so you only need to do this once. You 
can unlink your account at any time by navigating to User Menu &rarr; 
*Account Settings* &rarr; *General* &rarr; *Apps*, and clicking *Revoke* next to 
OneDrive&trade;.

## Creating Files

Follow these steps to create a new Documents and Media file via Office 
365&trade;: 

1.  Open the *Menu* 
    (![Product Menu](../../../../images/icon-menu.png)), 
    click your Site's name, and navigate to *Content & Data* &rarr; 
    *Documents and Media*. 

2.  Click the *Add* icon 
    (![Add](../../../../images/icon-add.png)) 
    and select the type of Office 365&trade; document to add to the Document 
    Library: 

    -   Word&trade;
    -   Excel&trade;
    -   PowerPoint&trade;

    When you select one of these options, a new window opens for you to enter 
    the document's name.

3.  Enter the document's name in the *Title* field, and click *Save*. When you 
    click *Save*, @product@ creates a temporary Documents and Media file and 
    links it to the new Office 365&trade; file. Your browser then opens a new 
    window with that Office 365&trade; file so you can create its content.

4.  Use the Office 365&trade; editor to create your document's content. 

5.  Save or discard your changes to @product@: 

    **Check in:** Saves the Office 365&trade; file to Documents and Media, then 
    deletes the file from Office 365&trade;. The saved file's format depends on 
    the document type you selected in step two above. 

    -   Word: Microsoft Word&trade; (`.docx`)
    -   PowerPoint: Microsoft PowerPoint&trade; (`.pptx`)
    -   Excel: Microsoft Excel&trade; (`.xlsx`)

    **Cancel Checkout:** Deletes the Office 365&trade; file, discarding any 
    changes. 

## Editing Files

You can use Office 365&trade; to edit the following types of Documents and 
Media files: 

-   Text files (`.doc`, `.docx`, `.docm`, `.dot`, `.dotx`, `.dotm`, `.html`, 
    `.txt`, `.rtf`, `.odt`)
-   Presentation files (`.ppt`, `.pptx`, `.pptm`, `.pps`, `.ppsx`, `.ppsm`,

-   Spreadsheet files (`.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.xlsm`, `.xlt`, `.xltx`, `.xltm`, 
    `.ods`, `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.txt`, `.tab`)

Follow these steps to edit a Documents and Media file in Office 365&trade;: 

1.  Navigate to the file in the Documents and Media Library. 

2.  Click the file's Actions icon 
    (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) 
    and select *Edit in Office 365*. This automatically 
    [checks out](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/checking-out-and-editing-files) 
    the file, transfers its content to a new Office 365&trade; file, and 
    redirects you to that file Office 365&trade;. 

3.  Edit the file in Office 365&trade;. The editing process is exactly the same 
    as described above for creating files.
