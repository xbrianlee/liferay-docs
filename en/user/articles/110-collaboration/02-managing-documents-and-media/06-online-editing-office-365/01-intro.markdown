# Integration with Microsoft Office 365â„¢

[TOC levels=1-4]

Although you can 
[add](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/adding-files-to-a-document-library#using-the-add-menu) 
and 
[edit](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/checking-out-and-editing-files) 
Documents and Media files via upload and download, @product@ doesn't contain a 
UI that lets you author or edit documents directly. You can, however, create and 
edit Documents and Media files online in Word&trade;, Excel&trade;, and 
PowerPoint&trade;. 

Note that when you use Office 365&trade; to create or edit a Documents and Media 
file, that file isn't permanently stored in Office 365&trade;. Office 365&trade; 
is only used for its editing UI. Your edits are then saved to the Documents and 
Media Library. 

Here you can learn how to use it.
