# Publishing Files

[TOC levels=1-4]

As you create sites, you'll probably want to share files on them. The Documents
and Media library (Document Library) lets you upload and publish all kinds of
files on your sites. Pictures, videos, spreadsheets, slide presentations, and
more can be stored in and shared from the Document Library. Document Library
instances can be scoped to a portal instance, site, or page, so you can work
with files where they're relevant. 

Here, you'll learn how to add files, display them, and collaborate on them. 
You'll learn how to use both the Documents and Media Library and the Media 
Gallery. And lastly, you'll learn how to collaborate on files from within 
several environments, including your browser and local desktop file system.
