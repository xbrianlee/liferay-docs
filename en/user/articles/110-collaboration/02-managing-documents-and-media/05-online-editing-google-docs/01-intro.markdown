# Online File Creation and Editing with Google Docsâ„¢

[TOC levels=1-4]

Although you can 
[add](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/adding-files-to-a-document-library#using-the-add-menu) 
and 
[edit](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/checking-out-and-editing-files) 
Documents and Media files via upload and download, @product@ doesn't contain a 
UI that lets you author or edit documents directly. You can, however, create and
edit Documents and Media files online in Google Docs&trade;, Google
Sheets&trade;, and Google Slides&trade;. 

| **Note:** For simplicity and readability, this documentation refers only to 
| Google Docs&trade;. The material, however, also applies to Google 
| Sheets&trade; and Google Slides&trade;. 

Note that when you use Google Docs&trade; to create or edit a Documents and 
Media file, that file isn't permanently stored in Google Docs&trade;. Google 
Docs&trade; is only used for its editing UI. Your edits are then saved to the 
Documents and Media Library.
