# Integrating with Facebook

[TOC levels=1-4]

@product@ provides tools for integrating your portal and its content with 
Facebook. For example, you can use Facebook for authentication and even export 
widgets as Facebook applications. This article shows you how. 

## Facebook Sign On

Like many websites you may visit, any site running on @product@ can use
Facebook for sign in. This makes it easier for users to sign in to your 
Site, since they don't need to remember another user name and password. 

<!--Uncomment once article is available

deployment documentation
for information on using Facebook to sign into @product@.

## Using Your Widget as Facebook Applications

You can add any @product@ widget as an app on Facebook. To do this, you must 
first get a developer key. A link for doing this is provided to you in the 
Facebook tab in any widget's Configuration screen. You must create the app on 
Facebook and get the key and canvas page URL from Facebook. You can then copy 
and paste their values into the Facebook tab. Once you do that, your widget is 
available on Facebook. 

This integration lets you make things like Message Boards, Calendars, Wikis, and 
other content on your website available to a much larger audience (unless you 
already have a billion users on your site, in which case, kudos to you). If 
you're a developer, you can implement your widget on @product@ and then publish 
it to Facebook.
