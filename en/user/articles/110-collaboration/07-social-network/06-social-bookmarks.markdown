# Using Social Bookmarks

[TOC levels=1-4]

Social bookmarks appear below content as buttons for sharing that content on
social networks. For example, social bookmarks appear by default in the Blogs
widget below each blog post. For more information on configuring social
bookmarks in the Blogs widget, see the documentation on 
[displaying blogs](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/displaying-blogs). 

These social bookmarks are available by default: 

-   Twitter
-   Facebook
-   LinkedIn
