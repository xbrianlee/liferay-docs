# Creating A Social Network

[TOC levels=1-4]

@product@ contains several features and widgets for leveraging its social
framework. The Activities widget lets you broadcast user activities on a Site.
This is a good way for Site members to see what's going on in their communities.
When placed on a user's private Dashboard, the Activities widget displays the
activities of that user's social connections. Users can make those social
connections via the Contacts Center app, which lets them establish connections
and followers throughout the portal. What's more, widgets can be exported as
OpenSocial gadgets and/or used with Facebook. 

This guide shows you how to do these things, and more.
