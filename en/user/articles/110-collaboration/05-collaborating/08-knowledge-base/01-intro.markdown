# Using the Knowledge Base

[TOC levels=1-4]

The Knowledge Base app can be used to display professional product documentation
or form complete books or guides. It even lets you import article source files
written in Markdown. It's 
[workflow-enabled](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/workflow), 
so you can require articles to be approved before publication. Additionally, you 
can create article templates that help users follow a common outline. 

Here are the Knowledge Base's key features: 

-   Navigation is built into Knowledge Base Display. 
-   The suggestions interface enables user feedback on articles. 
-   Articles are stored in folders.
-   Metadata fields exist for the friendly URL, source URL, categorization, and 
    related assets.
-   The *Edit on GitHub* button 
    (![GitHub](../../../../images/icon-edit-on-github.png)) 
    can take readers to an article's source repository location (if you choose 
    to use it that way). 
-   Markdown source files can be imported to create and update articles. 

The Knowledge Base has several widgets you can add to Site pages: 

- Knowledge Base Article 
- Knowledge Base Display 
- Knowledge Base Search 
- Knowledge Base Section
