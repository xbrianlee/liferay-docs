# Working Together with the Wiki

[TOC levels=1-4]

Wikis are for collaboratively building a collection of information. The most
famous wiki on the planet is Wikipedia. It's a full encyclopedia developed
collaboratively by users from all over the world, using a wiki. @product@'s wiki
does these things: 

-   Creates multiple wikis in a single wiki app instance. 
-   Scopes wikis to a page, a site, or the entire portal. 
-   Creates and edit wikis in 
    [WikiCreole syntax](http://www.wikicreole.org/). 
-   Attaches files to wiki articles. 
-   Associates wiki articles with other assets in the portal. 
-   And more.

As you can see, @product@'s wiki is flexible and can be configured to fit 
nearly any use case. What's more, it's completely integrated with the portal's 
[user management](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/managing-users), 
[tagging](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/tagging-content), and
[security](/docs/7-2/deploy/-/knowledge_base/d/securing-product) 
features.
