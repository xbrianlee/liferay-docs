# Collaborating

[TOC levels=1-4]

Your users can leverage a robust suite of collaboration apps to get things done
and form extensive communities. These apps provide all the features that you
would expect of standalone apps, but these apps are integrated: they share
a common look and feel, security model, and architecture because of Liferay's
development framework. You can use them in combination with user registration
and content management features to build a well-integrated, feature-rich site. 

This guide shows you how to administer and use the collaboration apps: 

-   Blogs
-   Message Boards
-   Wiki
-   Alerts and Announcements
-   Knowledge Base
-   Bookmarks
