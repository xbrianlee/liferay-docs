# Assets

[TOC levels=1-4]

When you think of assets, you probably think of things like houses, cars, money, 
or gold bricks. Although @product@ is capable of holding many assets, they
aren't financial assets. Assets in @product@ are any kind of content. For
example, images, documents, and web content are all assets. And although such
assets may not have the tangible value of a gold brick, they could equal or even
exceed that value when used to support an organization's day-to-day business
activities. You might even think of @product@ as your very own Fort Knox (don't 
worry, we won't tell anyone). 

Here, you'll learn to configure @product@ to apply 
[tags](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/tagging-content) 
to assets automatically.
