# Adapting Your Media Across Multiple Devices

[TOC levels=1-4]

Media providers must consider differences between devices (phones, laptops,
tablets, etc.) when delivering content: not only their screen size but also
their bandwidth and processing capabilities. @product@'s Adaptive Media app
allows administrators to control image quality and dynamically adjusts uploaded
media to best fit the screen being used. 

| **Note:** At this time, Adaptive Media only works for images in blog entries 
| and web content articles. 

Adaptive Media integrates with Documents and Media, Blogs, and Web Content. It
generates a set of images for use on various screens. When the content is
accessed, Adaptive Media checks the screen type and resolution and selects
appropriate the appropriate image. Adaptive Media comes preinstalled in 
@product@. 

In this section, you'll learn how to manage and use Adaptive Media.
