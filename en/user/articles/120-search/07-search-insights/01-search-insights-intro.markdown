# Search Insights

[TOC levels=1-4]

**[Feature intended for testing and development only]**

**[Works with Elasticsearch only]**

Add the Search Insights Widget to the Search Page to inspect two things: 

- The query string that's constructed by the back-end search code when
    the User enters a keyword 

- The response string returned from the search engine

| **Note:** The JSON returned as a request string is pruned from several
| Elasticsearch query defaults for clarity. To see the full request JSON that
| Elasticsearch processed, adjust the [Elasticsearch server's
| logging](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.x/logging.html).

In @product-ver@, the Insights widget now adds the response string to
the widget's output, and the _Enable Score Explanation_ option (enabled by
default) prints a relevance score explanation for each returned result.

When a search query is processed, results are returned. The concept of
_Relevance_ determines how well results match the query. The Score explanation
for returned search documents helps clarify seemingly odd results, letting you
adjust the relevancy scoring process by making matches in certain fields count
for more (_boosting_ the fields is the term for this).

## Inspecting The Search Query String

To see the Search Insights widget in action, navigate to a Search Page in your
test server and add it from the Add menu
(![Add](../../../images/icon-add-widget.png)).

Once you search for keywords that return Search Results, the Search Insights
portlet displays the returned query string in all its glory.

## Explaining Search Results

To enable or disable the Explain option,

1.  Open the Search Insight widget's Configuration screen.

2.  There's just one option: _Enable Score Explanation_.  It's a boolean field
    that's enabled by default.  De-select it to disable the explanation of each
    result's relevance score.

Under the hood, the Explain option in the Search Insights widget is exposing an
Elasticsearch API:
[Explain](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/search-explain.html).
See the Elasticsearch documentation for more details.

Here's an abbreviated portion of the scoring explanation for the Search
Document of the Test Test User when the searched keyword was _test_:

    ```json
    _explanation":{  
       "value":9.461341,
       "description":"sum of:",
       "details":[  
          {  
             "value":9.461341,
             "description":"sum of:",
             "details":[  
                {  
                   "value":1.0,
                   "description":"emailAddress:*test*",
                   "details":[  

                   ]
                },
                {  
                   "value":5.0,
                   "description":"userName:*test*^5.0",
                   "details":[  

                   ]
                },
                {  
                   "value":0.72928625,
                   "description":"sum of:",
                   "details":[  
                      ... 

                { 
                   "value":1.0027686,
                   "description":"sum of:",
                   "details":[  
                      ...
                      {  
                {  
                   "value":0.72928625,
                   "description":"sum of:",
                   "details":[  
                      ...
                {  
                   "value":1.0,
                   "description":"screenName:*test*",
                   "details":[  

                   ]
                }
             ]
          },
          ...
       ]
    }}]}
    ```

Now you're able to see the entire query string, the response string, and how
each returned Search Document was scored.
