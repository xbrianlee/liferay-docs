# Search Results

[TOC levels=1-4]

The ideal search experience involves a User entering a search term, waiting an
infinitesimal amount of time, and having the perfectly matching asset delivered
at the top of a list of other extremely relevant hits. Like this:

The developers of an asset control much about how the asset's information is
stored in the search engine (this process is called *indexing*, and how its
information is searched and returned in the search results.  Developers who
dislike how a particular asset behaves in search can use an *Indexer Post
Processor* to modify the asset's indexing behavior and how search queries are
constructed to look up the assets in @product@.

The Search Results behavior configurable through the UI is covered in this
section:
