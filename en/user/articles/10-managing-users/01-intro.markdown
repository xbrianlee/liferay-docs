# Managing Users

[TOC levels=1-4]

Ever heard a retailer advertise as a "one stop shop" for anything you want? The
idea is they have so much stuff that whatever you want is probably there.
Liferay's Control Panel is like this. Where do you create Users, Organizations,
or Sites? Where do you configure permissions and plugins and pretty much
anything else? You do it from the Control Panel.

The Control Panel is divided into six main areas: Users, Sites, Apps,
Configuration, and Workflow. The Users section lets you create and
manage Users, Organizations, User Groups, Roles, and Password Policies. If
monitoring has been enabled, you can also view all the live sessions of your
Users.

| **Anonymous User:** *Anonymous Anonymous* is used for the new
| [Managing User Data](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/managing-user-data)
| functionality. Created the first time an administrator clicks *Delete Personal
| Data* for a User, *Anonymous Anonymous* is a deactivated User assigned
| [anonymized assets](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/managing-user-data#anonymizing-data).
| The Anonymous User is configurable, so the name and configuration details might
| be different in your virtual instance.
