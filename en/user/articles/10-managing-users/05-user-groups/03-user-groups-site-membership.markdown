# User Groups and Site Membership

[TOC levels=1-4]

User Groups are used to manage Site membership. When you assign a User Group 
to a Site, the group's Users become members of that Site. This is one of the 
main use cases for User Groups. 

Follow these steps to assign a user group to a Site:

1.  Open the Menu 
    (![Menu](../../../images/icon-menu.png)), 
    select the Site you want to work in, then open its Site Administration menu. 

2.  In the Site Administration menu, select *People* &rarr; *Memberships*. 
    This opens the Site Memberships screen.

3.  In Memberships, select the *User Groups* tab. This tab displays any User
    Groups currently assigned to the Site. 

4.  Click the *Add* button 
    (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)), 
    select any User Groups you want to assign to the Site, then click *Done*. 
    The user groups you selected now appear in the User Groups tab.
