# Configuring User Group Permissions

[TOC levels=1-4]

Administrators commonly create User Groups so the group's Users can take some
specific action in a Site. This is done by assigning the permissions for that
action to a Role, and then assigning that Role to the User Group. This grants
the Role's permissions to the User Group's Users. 

Follow these steps to grant permissions to Users in a User Group: 

1.  [Create the User Group](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/creating-a-user-group).
2.  [Assign the User Group to a Site](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/user-groups-and-site-membership). 
3.  [Create the Site Role and define its permissions](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/roles-and-permissions). 
4.  Assign the Role to the User Group. 

For instructions on the first three steps, click those links above. This article
shows you how to assign a Role to a User Group: 

1.  Open the Menu 
    (![Menu](../../../images/icon-menu.png)), 
    select the Site to work in, then open its Site Administration menu. 

2.  In the Site Administration menu, select *People* &rarr; *Memberships*. 
    This opens the Memberships screen.

3.  In Memberships, select the *User Groups* tab. This tab displays 
    User Groups currently assigned to the Site. 

4.  Click the *Actions* button 
    (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) 
    for the User Group you want to assign to a Role, and select 
    *Assign Site Roles*. This opens the Assign Site Roles dialog.

5.  In the Assign Site Roles dialog, select the Role from the list and click 
    *Done*.
