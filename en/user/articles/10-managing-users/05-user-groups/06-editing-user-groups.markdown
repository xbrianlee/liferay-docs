# Editing User Groups

[TOC levels=1-4]

You can access User Groups from *Control Panel* &rarr; *Users* &rarr; *User
Groups*. Managing membership is the most common action you'll likely perform on
a User Group. 

![Figure 1: The user groups appear in a table.](../../../images/user-groups-table.png)

Follow these steps to add/remove users to/from a User Group: 

1.  Click the User Group's name or description. Alternatively, you can click the 
    User Group's *Actions* button 
    (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) 
    and select *Assign Members*. This presents a list of the User Group's users. 

2.  To remove a User from the User Group, click the `X` button next to that 
    User. To remove multiple Users at once, check each User's checkbox and then 
    click the trash icon 
    (![Trash](../../../images/icon-trash.png)) 
    that appears in the Management Bar above the User list. 

3.  To add Users to the User Group, click the *Add* button 
    (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)). 
    In the dialog that appears, select the Users and click *Add*.

Other options are available in each User Group's Actions button 
(![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)): 

**Edit:** Modify the User Group's name or description, or choose Site 
templates to use for the 
[User Group's Sites](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/user-group-sites).

**Permissions:** Assign permissions for viewing and managing the User Group. 

**User Group Pages Permissions:** Assign permissions for managing the User 
Group's Site pages. 

**Manage Pages:** Manually manage the User Group's Site pages. See the 
[documentation on user group Sites](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/user-group-sites#creating-user-group-sites-manually)
for details. 

**Assign Members:** Add/remove Users to/from the User Group. This is 
described in detail above. 

**Delete:** Remove the User Group. Note that you can't delete a User Group 
that contains Users. You must first remove the Users from the group. 

If your User Group has public and private Site pages, the options 
*Go to Profile Pages* and *Go to Dashboard Pages* also appear in your User 
Group's Actions menu. Clicking one of these links opens that Site in a new 
browser window. See the 
[documentation on user group Sites](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/user-group-sites) 
for details.
