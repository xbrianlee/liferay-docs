# Polls

[TOC levels=1-4]

How can The Lunar Resort stay connected with its earthbound client√®le from
239,000 miles away? Make them feel really involved and enthusiastic about the
resort by asking them for feedback. You're not just creating a poll, you're
making connections.

Use Polls to find out what your site visitors are thinking and keep them engaged
with your site's content.

Two applications make and display a poll: the *Polls* application in the Site
Menu and the *Polls Display* widget you add to a page.

## Creating a Poll

From the Site Menu, go to *Content & Data* &rarr; *Polls*. 

1.  Click the ![Add](../images/icon-add.png) button and fill out the form. 

    ![Figure 1: Besides the Title and the Polls Question, you must enter data for each of the Choices fields when creating a new poll.](../images/polls-add-new-question.png)

    **Title:** (Required) Enter the name of the poll question. 

    **Polls Question:** (Required) Enter the text of the poll question. 

    **Expiration Date:** Enter the date and time you want the poll to expire. 

    **Choices:** Enter at least two options for the poll question. 

    **Add Choice:** Enter additional answer options for the poll question. 

    **Permissions:** Manage who can view and edit the poll. 

2.  Click *Save* to add the poll to the Polls application. 

Once a poll is created, the Polls Display portlet publishes it until it expires
or is deleted. Set an expiration date for a poll by selecting the day and time
in the Add Poll form. The default is set to *Never Expire*. 

When a published poll expires, the poll results are displayed, but users can't
add new entries. To remove an expired poll from a page, remove the Poll Display
portlet or configure it to show another poll question. See the section below for
more details about the Polls Display portlet. 

*Permissions* are set on individual polls. Use permissions, for example, to
allow some privileged users to vote on a certain poll question, while others can
only view it. 

Creating a poll is fairly straightforward. Next, complete the two-step
process and put your poll on a page.

## Adding a Poll to a Page

Now that you have created your poll question, you can present it to your users:

1.  Go to a page and add a Polls Display widget from *Add* &rarr; *Widgets*
    &rarr; *Content Management*.

2.  Click *Please configure this portlet to make it visible to all users.*

3.  In the dialog box that appears, select the poll to display.

4.  Click *Save*.

Once the poll question has been placed on the page, perform other tasks using
the icons at the bottom of the portlet.

**Edit Question:** Displays a similar dialog box to the one used to create the
poll. 

**Select Poll:** Displays the same dialog box as Configuration, allowing you to
choose different polls from the drop-down menu. 

**Add:** Allows you to create a new poll. 

## Viewing Poll Results

All the polls you create appear in the Polls portlet in the Site Menu &rarr;
*Content & Data* &rarr; *Polls*. When users vote in the poll, the data is 
collected here. Click on a poll to see a breakdown of the results.

![Figure 3: Selecting a poll in the Polls portlet puts the data at your fingertips.](../images/polls-results.png)

If you click on one of the listed *Charts*, the portlet generates an
appropriate visualization of the data.

Below this is an item called *Charts*. This option shows the poll results
represented in various graphs. The graphs are *Area*, *Horizontal Bar*, *Line*,
*Pie*, and *Vertical Bar*.

![Figure 4: This is what the vertical bar graph for the Lunar Resort poll results looks like.](../images/polls-results-vertical-bar.png)

There is also a listing of the users who voted in the poll, how they voted,
and a time/date stamp of when their votes were cast. Registered users are
represented by name. Guest users have a blank _User_ field.
