Liferay's workflow engine is named *Kaleo*. In Greek, Kaleo means "called ones,"
which is appropriate for a workflow engine that calls users to participate in a
review process designed for them. Workflow makes it possible to define any
number of simple to complex business processes/workflows, deploy them, and
manage them through a portal interface. The processes have knowledge of Users,
Groups and Roles. You don't have to write a single line of code to accomplish
this: it's defined in an XML document. If you're a Liferay Digital Experience
Platform (DXP) customer, you also have access to a visual process builder.

There are several steps to effective workflowing:

- [Designing review processes in XML](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/crafting-xml-workflow-definitions)

- (DXP only) [Visually designing review processes](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028821892-Workflow-Designer)

- [Uploading workflow definitions](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/managing-workflows#uploading-workflow-definitions)

- [Activating workflow for enabled assets](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/activating-workflow)

- [Managing Workflow definitions](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/managing-workflows)

- [Sending assets through review](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/reviewing-assets)

- (DXP only) [Using Workflow Metrics](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029042071-Workflow-Metrics-The-Service-Level-Agreement-SLA-)

After all that, you'll be familiar with using Liferay's workflow engine to set
up approval processes for any
[workflow-enabled content](/docs/7-2/user/-/knowledge_base/u/activating-workflow).

## What's New with Workflow?

There are some noteworthy enhancements to the workflow functionality:

### DXP Feature: Workflow Metrics

For DXP subscribers, the _Workflow Metrics_ feature was introduced. Configure
one or more Service Level Agreements (SLAs; think of these as deadlines) on a
workflow definition's events, and workflow submissions are accordingly tracked
and reported as on time or overdue.

#### Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

SLAs define the deadlines on a workflow process's events. They're like a
contract between the workflow participants and Users submitting workflow items.

SLAs can be formally agreed-upon deadlines between you and your customers, or
informally created to meet internal goals, tracking events such as:

- Total time to resolution
- Time to complete a specific workflow task

![Figure 1: Use Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to define how workflow metrics are reported.](../../images/workflow-add-sla.png)

For each workflow event to track, set the SLA duration and when the timer should
be paused, if at all.

#### Workflow Reports

Once an SLA is set, workflow submissions that trigger the SLA timer are
automatically reported on by the workflow metrics framework, and given the
status _on time_ or _overdue_.

![Figure 2: See Workflow Reports generated based on your SLAs.](../../images/workflow-report.png)

See the article on
[Workflow Metrics](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029042071-Workflow-Metrics-The-Service-Level-Agreement-SLA-)
to learn more about SLAs and available reports.

### Control Panel Reorganization

The Workflow section of the Control Panel is now a top-level section with its
own subcategories: Process Builder and Submissions (Metrics, too, if you're a
DXP subscriber). In @product@ 7.1 Workflow was nested under Control Panel
&rarr; Configuration.

![Figure 3: Workflow has a top-level entry in the Control Panel.](../../images/workflow-menu.png)

### Workflow Definition Permissions: System Settings

The Workflow System Settings category (Control Panel &rarr; Configuration &rarr;
System Settings) has a new system scoped configuration entry: _Workflow
Definitions_. There's just one configuration option, but it's important:
Enabling it gives administrators permission to publish workflows and scripts.

![Figure 4: Explicit permission must be granted before administrators are allowed to publish and edit workflow definitions.](../../images/workflow-publication-permission.png)

Create your own workflows from scratch or leverage existing workflows.

## Embedded Workflows

In addition to the Single Approver definition, there are some workflow
definitions that ship with @product@ but are not pre-installed, since they're
primarily included for test cases. They can be found in the Liferay source code
in

    /modules/apps/portal-workflow/portal-workflow-kaleo-runtime-impl/src/main/resources/META-INF/definitions

They're also in your Liferay installation. Open your Liferay installation's
`osgi/portal/com.liferay.portal.workflow.kaleo.runtime.impl.jar`, and then find
and open the `com.liferay.workflow.kaleo.runtime.impl-[version].jar`. The
definitions are in the `META-INF/definitions` folder.
