# Content Publication Management

[TOC levels=1-4]

Today's enterprises generate an enormous amount of content. You can use advanced
publishing tools to manage content for a seamless publication experience.

Staging lets you change your Site behind the scenes without affecting the live
Site. This is done by creating your Site in a temporary staging area (local or
remote) and then publishing all the changes at once. 

<!-- This is the supported way to manage content publication.

@product@ also offers Change Lists, which provide a flexible way to manage
different site versions, including its assets and how they are displayed. Change
Lists let users group changes into one set and publish those changes when
they are ready. This is a beta feature and is not supported at this time. Only
enable the Change Lists feature for testing purposes. -->
