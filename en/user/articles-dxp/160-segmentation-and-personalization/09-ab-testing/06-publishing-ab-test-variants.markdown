# Publishing A/B Test Variants

[TOC levels=1-4]

Once the A/B test has concluded and Analytics Cloud has computed the test
results, the status for the test displays as *Winner Declared* (if a winning
Variant was found) or *No Winner* in the A/B Test sidebar panel. You're
also alerted to the result via a notification, which you can view from the User
Menu.

| **Note:** When the required confidence level is not met during the time
| duration, there is no winning Variant.

Click the *Publish* button to publish your winning Variant Experience. Once you
publish a Variant, the A/B test's status is *Completed* and the test is
finished.

Test* to ignore the A/B test recommendations and keep the currently published
Control Page.
