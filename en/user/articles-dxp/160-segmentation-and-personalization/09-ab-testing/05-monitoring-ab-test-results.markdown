# Monitoring A/B Test Results

[TOC levels=1-4]

The information from your A/B test created in @product@ is automatically
synchronized with
[Analytics Cloud](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006608732). The
test results used to calculate the winning Variant based on user interaction
data is viewable there. You can also view your A/B testing history, meaningful
statistics, helpful graphs, etc. from Analytics Cloud.

To navigate to your test's Analytics Cloud dashboard from @product@, click the
*View Data in Analytics Cloud* button in the A/B Test sidebar panel while it's
running.

@product@ only displays your test's status (draft, running, etc.) and the
winning Variant once the test finishes. For more information on what you can
view/manage from Analytics Cloud in relation to your A/B test, see the
[A/B Testing Analytics](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/sections/360001492292-Analyzing-Touchpoints)
article.
