# A/B Testing

[TOC levels=1-4]

| **Note:** A/B Testing is available for Liferay DXP 7.2 SP1+.

@product@ can help you hone your messages to customers by periodically testing
different UX and messaging schemes. You can show different versions of your site
to different users to see which is more effective. 

*A/B Testing* lets you maintain a page's current UX and messaging, but provide
alternative page variants for a select group of visitors. Then the current page
and page variant(s) are tested based on algorithms to determine which pages
perform better for a given goal (e.g., bounce rate, clicks, etc.).

For example, a Marketing team for a bank provides a Content Page advertising
a new credit card. The page has been published for a few weeks, but a redesign
might help promote the new credit card better. With A/B Testing, the team can
create a new page variant and display both pages at random to visitors. Then
they can analyze the clickthrough rate for the two pages and find which page is
more effective. If the new variant is more effective than the original page,
they can publish it and remove the old page.
