# Using Analytics Cloud With User Segments

[TOC levels=1-4]

To use Analytics Cloud with User Segments, you must first connect your DXP data 
source to Analytics Cloud and enable synchronization of users and analytics. For 
more information about Analytics Cloud, including instructions for connecting 
it with DXP, see the official
[Analytics Cloud Documentation](https://learn.liferay.com/analytics-cloud/latest/en/connecting-data-sources/connecting-liferay-dxp-to-analytics-cloud.html).

Once you're connected to Analytics Cloud, you can create Segments to analyze
user behavior.

## Creating a New Segment

Synchronization with Analytics Cloud is not instant, so once you have connected 
Analytics Cloud and Liferay DXP, you must first wait for the users and data to 
synchronize. After that completes, you can create Segments in Analytics Cloud to 
capture data in DXP.

Only Segments that contain at least one member are synchronized with Liferay
DXP. This means that empty Segments created with Analytics Cloud are unavailable
to use on Liferay DXP.

See Analytics Cloud's documentation on
[creating Segments](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006947671-Creating-Segments)
for more information.

Next, you can use your new Segment to define behaviors on your server.

## Getting Segment Analytics

After you create and sync a Segment in Analytics Cloud, you can view it and
customize it in @product@.

1.  Go to the *Segments* page.

2.  Click on the new Segment.

Analytics are based on the criteria that you set on Analytics Cloud, 
but you can set additional criteria here to use this Segment for 
personalization in DXP. Changing the Segment criteria here doesn't affect the 
gathered analytics data, unless it is configured in some way that restricts its
members from viewing content that you are using as an Analytics Cloud criteria.

When you put it all together to provide personalized experiences and analyze 
user behavior, you can see the true power of Segmentation.
