# Managing Your Published App

[TOC levels=1-4]

You've launched your new app on the Marketplace. Congratulations! As you settle
down from your launch celebration, you might wonder how your app is performing
in the Marketplace. Is there a way to monitor how many people are viewing it and
downloading it? And what about those features that didn't make this release? How
difficult is it to upload your app's next version with those features? Don't
sweat it. The Liferay Marketplace and app wizard are here to help. 

You can track app performance. Marketplace shows app trends like views,
downloads, and purchases. You can upload new versions of your app and make
changes to some of its details with the App Wizard. Read on to learn how all of
this works.
