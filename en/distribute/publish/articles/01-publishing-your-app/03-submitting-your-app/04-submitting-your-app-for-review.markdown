# Submitting Your App For Review

[TOC levels=1-4]

The *App Preview* screen lets you preview your app as it will appear on the
Marketplace. If you want to change things before finally submitting your app,
click *Edit* to go back and continue making changes until you're satisfied.

Before finalizing your app's submission, make sure that you're pleased with the
values you've set for the following app details, as these details can't be
modified once the app is approved: 

- Free vs. paid
- License term (perpetual vs. non-perpetual)
- Support subscription offering (cannot be removed)

Once you are satisfied, click *Submit for Review*. 

At this point, the Liferay Marketplace staff starts to review your app and test
it. If you need to make changes to your app during its review or if you're
curious about the rigors of the review process, make sure to read the next
section of this guide.
