# Submitting Your App

[TOC levels=1-4]

Now that you have everything in order for publishing your app, you can start the
Marketplace app submission process. 

Go to your *Account Home* on 
[liferay.com](http://www.liferay.com). 
In the left side navigation panel of your profile page, there are links to pages
related to using apps and developing apps. Links to *Apps* and *Metrics* appear
in the *Development* section of the navigation panel. You'll use these
links heavily during development, so you may want to bookmark this page too.
Click *Apps* from the *Development* section to access your app development page. 

![Figure 1: Your app development page lists the apps you've developed and enables you to add new apps for publishing to the Marketplace.](../../../images/marketplace-my-app-manager.png) 

Now that you know how to get to your app development page, you can submit your
app! It involves,

- [Specifying your app's initial details](/how-to-publish/-/knowledge_base/publish/specify-your-apps-initial-details)
- [Uploading your app](/how-to-publish/-/knowledge_base/publish/uploading-your-app)
- [Creating your licensing and pricing model](/how-to-publish/-/knowledge_base/publish/creating-your-licensing-and-pricing-model)
- [Submitting your app for review](/how-to-publish/-/knowledge_base/publish/submitting-your-app-for-review)

To begin the process of publishing your app, click *Add New App*. The app wizard
appears, so that you can fill in your app's details.
