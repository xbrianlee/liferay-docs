# Licensing and Pricing Your App

[TOC levels=1-4]

You have significant control over how to price your app. You choose the license
term (perpetual vs. annual), choose the license type (standard vs. developer),
define a pricing structure (pricing and bundled discounting based on a license
unit), and specify regional availability. Even after your app is on the
Marketplace, you can tweak general pricing or modify regional pricing. Here
you'll learn how to do all these things. 

## Determining a License Term

Here are the license term options:

- Perpetual license: does not expire.

- Non-perpetual license: must be renewed annually.

Importantly, you can't change your app's license terms once the app is approved.
Releasing an approved app under a different license term requires submitting
another app under a new name (title). So make sure to think through the license
term that makes the most sense for your app. 

| **Note:** If you are a foreign developer based outside of the United States,
| non-perpetual license sales (considered to be royalty income) to US customers
| are subject to a 30% withholding tax. This tax does not apply to perpetual
| licenses. For more information on licensing terms and fees, please refer to the
| [FAQ](/faq).

## Determining License Type and License Unit Pricing

Licenses are set to run on a permitted number of Instance Units (defined as a
single installation of the Liferay, which corresponds to one (1) Liferay `.war`
file). You can create tiers of bundled options to accommodate the number of
Instance Units to offer to customers. You can also offer a discounted price for
a bundle of multiple Instance Units.

There are two types of licenses that you can offer for your app: standard
licenses and developer licenses. Standard licenses are intended for production
server environments. Developer licenses are limited to 10 unique IP addresses
and, therefore, should not be used for full-scale production deployments.

You can also offer subscription services or 30-day trials. Support, maintenance,
and updates should comprise subscription services.

Depending on how you decide to license your app, you have a few options to
consider with regard to subscription services: 

**If you're offering a perpetual license...**

You can offer annually renewable subscription services. During the app
submission process if you choose to *offer subscription services*, you're asked
to price subscription services on a *per Instance Unit per year* basis. The
first year of subscription services is included with a perpetual license. If a
customer wants to continue receiving services after the first year, the customer
must renew subscription services at the price you designate. Customers are
entitled to support, maintenance, and updates as long as they continue to
annually renew subscription services. 

If you choose not to offer subscription services, customers are entitled to only
app updates, if and when updates become available. This type of one-time,
upfront payment model may work well for less complex apps and themes/templates. 

**If you're offering a non-perpetual (annual/renewable) license...**

You can offer annually renewable subscription services. During the app
submission process if you choose to *offer subscription services*, you should
build the price of subscription services into the annual price of the
non-perpetual license; please take this into account as you price non-perpetual
licenses. In effect, the customer pays one price annually for both the app
license and subscription services. The customer is entitled to support,
maintenance, and updates as long as they continue to renew their non-perpetual
license.

If you choose not to offer subscription services, customers are entitled to only
app updates if and when updates become available. They can receive updates as
long as they continue to have valid non-perpetual licenses. 

## Setting Prices for License Options by Region

You can specify countries your app will be available in and the app's price in
in each of those countries. You can make it as simple (single price offered
globally) or as granular (different price in each country offered) as you want.

Choose the currency to use with your pricing options. Decide on the renewal cost
for any support services you offer. The support services price is per instance,
so if you specify $100 USD and the customer is running 10 instances, their
annual support services renewal cost will be $1000. Note: This only applies to
perpetual licenses. For non-perpetual licenses, include any support services
cost in the annual license price. 

Even after an app has been approved, you can change the currency type and
currency price of its license bundles, and you can modify regional availability
of license bundles. 

Although Liferay Marketplace supports major currencies and a broad list of
countries, not all currencies and countries are currently available. Additional
currencies and countries may become available at a later time. 

## Considering the Liferay Marketplace Fee

By selling your paid apps on the Liferay Marketplace, you're agreeing to share
app sales revenue with Liferay. For each app sale, you receive 80% of the sales
proceeds and Liferay receives 20% of the sales proceeds. We believe this type of
fee structure is extremely competitive compared to other app marketplaces. 
Liferay uses its share of app sale proceeds to:

- Operate and improve the Liferay Marketplace.
- Provide developer services, such as payment processing, license tracking, and
performance metrics. 
- Continue investing in and growing the Liferay ecosystem.

As you can see, Liferay's fee is reasonable. 

You need a valid PayPal account to receive payment; you're asked to provide this
info when registering for or converting to a Paid App Developer Account.
Payments are issued no later than 90 days after the transaction. 

Now that you've decided on licensing options and pricing, you can concentrate on
the Liferay versions your app runs on.
